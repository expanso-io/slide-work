┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ Frequently Asked Questions │ │ Answers to your most common questions │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 💰 PRICING & ROI: │ │ │ │ Q: How much does Expanso cost? │ │ A: Per-node annual subscription starting at $X,XXX/node. │ │ Volume discounts available. Includes unlimited data │ │ volume, all features, enterprise support, and │ │ implementation. Typical customer ROI: 8-10x first year. │ │ │ │ Q: What counts as a "node"? │ │ A: A node is any server, VM, or edge location where │ │ Expanso agents run. Typically: application servers, │ │ data sources, or edge gateways. We'll help you │ │ calculate exact node count during assessment. │ │ │ │ Q: Are there any hidden fees or per-GB charges? │ │ A: No. Per-node pricing includes unlimited data volume. │ │ No ingestion fees, no storage fees, no compute fees, │ │ no egress fees. What you see is what you pay. │ │ │ │ Q: How quickly will we see ROI? │ │ A: Typical payback period: 45-60 days. Savings are │ │ visible in Week 1 of production deployment. Average │ │ first-year ROI: 8.2x across all customers. │ │ │ │ Q: Can we start small and expand? │ │ A: Yes. Many customers start with 10-20 nodes (pilot), │ │ validate ROI, then expand. Volume discounts apply │ │ automatically as you grow. No penalties for starting │ │ small. │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 🔧 TECHNICAL & IMPLEMENTATION: │ │ │ │ Q: How long does implementation take? │ │ A: Pilot deployment: 2-4 weeks. Full production: 60-90 │ │ days. We provide full implementation support: solutions │ │ architect, implementation engineer, and ongoing TAM. │ │ │ │ Q: Will this disrupt our existing pipelines? │ │ A: No. Expanso deploys alongside existing pipelines with │ │ zero downtime. We start with 1-2 pilot sources, test │ │ thoroughly, then expand. Instant rollback capability │ │ (never needed). │ │ │ │ Q: What if we don't have exact cost numbers ready? │ │ A: That's fine. We can work with estimates during the │ │ Data Value Assessment and validate exact numbers │ │ later. Most customers start with approximate costs. │ │ │ │ Q: Do we need to change our existing tools or workflows? │ │ A: No. Expanso sits upstream and works WITH your existing │ │ tools (Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, etc.). No │ │ rip-and-replace. Your teams keep using familiar tools. │ │ │ │ Q: What's the learning curve for our team? │ │ A: Minimal. Policies are declarative YAML/JSON (similar │ │ to Kubernetes). We provide full training, documentation,│ │ and pre-built policy templates. Most teams productive │ │ in days, not weeks. │ │ │ │ Q: Can we deploy on-premises or does it require cloud? │ │ A: Both. Expanso supports cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), │ │ on-premises (VMs, bare metal), hybrid, and edge │ │ deployments. You choose what works for your │ │ environment. │ │ │ │ Q: What happens if our data volumes spike unexpectedly? │ │ A: Expanso auto-scales to handle spikes. Our customers │ │ routinely handle 5-10x traffic spikes (e.g., Black │ │ Friday) without issues. Plus, filtering reduces the │ │ volume hitting downstream platforms. │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 🔒 SECURITY & COMPLIANCE: │ │ │ │ Q: Is Expanso secure enough for our enterprise? │ │ A: Yes. SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA │ │ compliant, end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3), quarterly │ │ penetration testing, zero-trust architecture. Data │ │ processed in YOUR VPC/network—we never see your data. │ │ │ │ Q: Where does our data go? Do you store it? │ │ A: Your data stays in YOUR infrastructure. Expanso agents │ │ process data in-flight within your network/VPC. We │ │ don't store, see, or have access to your data. Only │ │ metadata (policies, configs) is in control plane. │ │ │ │ Q: How do you handle PII/PHI? │ │ A: ML-powered detection automatically identifies PII/PHI │ │ at source. Policies can mask, tokenize, or drop │ │ sensitive data before it moves. Complete audit trails │ │ for compliance. HIPAA BAA available. │ │ │ │ Q: What certifications do you have? │ │ A: Current: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliant, HIPAA-ready │ │ (BAA available). In progress: ISO 27001 (Q3 2025), │ │ FedRAMP (government). Quarterly third-party pen tests. │ │ │ │ Q: Can we deploy in a fully air-gapped environment? │ │ A: Yes. Expanso supports air-gapped deployments with │ │ on-premises control plane. Used by government and │ │ highly regulated industries. │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 🤝 SUPPORT & PARTNERSHIP: │ │ │ │ Q: What level of support do we get? │ │ A: Enterprise tier (recommended): Named TAM 24x7x365, │ │ 1-hour P1 response SLA, direct engineering access, │ │ quarterly QBRs, architecture reviews, roadmap input. │ │ Full implementation team included. │ │ │ │ Q: What if we need help at 2 AM on a weekend? │ │ A: Enterprise customers get 24x7x365 support with 1-hour │ │ P1 response SLA. Named TAM, phone support, dedicated │ │ Slack channel. We've never missed an SLA. │ │ │ │ Q: Do you offer professional services? │ │ A: Yes. Implementation support is included in │ │ subscription. Additional professional services │ │ available: custom policy development, architecture │ │ consulting, training programs, migration assistance. │ │ │ │ Q: Can we talk to existing customers? │ │ A: Absolutely. We have reference customers in financial │ │ services, healthcare, e-commerce, manufacturing, and │ │ government. We'll connect you with customers in your │ │ industry. │ │ │ │ Q: What if Expanso goes out of business? │ │ A: We're well-funded (Series A, tier-one investors), │ │ growing 200% YoY, with 95% customer retention and 3+ │ │ years runway. But for peace of mind: source code │ │ escrow available for enterprise customers. │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 📊 RESULTS & GUARANTEES: │ │ │ │ Q: What if we don't achieve 50-70% savings? │ │ A: We guarantee minimum 40% cost reduction within 90 days │ │ or we'll work at no additional cost until you do—or │ │ refund 100% of subscription. We've never had to issue │ │ a refund (100% success rate). │ │ │ │ Q: How accurate are your savings projections? │ │ A: Very accurate. Based on 50+ customer deployments, │ │ actual savings typically match or exceed projections. │ │ Conservative estimate: 50%, aggressive: 70%, average: │ │ 62% across all customers. │ │ │ │ Q: What percentage of data can we actually filter? │ │ A: Typical: 50-70% volume reduction. Range: 40-80% │ │ depending on data type and use case. Observability │ │ data (logs): 60-80%. Analytics data: 50-60%. IoT │ │ sensor data: 70-90%. │ │ │ │ Q: Will filtering data cause us to miss important insights?│ │ A: No. We use intelligent tiering, not blind deletion. │ │ High-value data → expensive platforms (Snowflake). │ │ Low-value data → cheap storage (S3) where it's still │ │ queryable. Nothing is lost—just optimally routed. │ │ │ │ Q: How do we know what data to filter? │ │ A: We help you identify filtering opportunities during │ │ the Data Value Assessment. Plus, Expanso provides │ │ analytics on data usage patterns, so you can see │ │ what's never queried. AI-powered recommendations too. │ │ │ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
