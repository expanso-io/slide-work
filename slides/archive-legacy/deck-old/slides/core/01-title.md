Generate a professional presentation title slide for a sales deck with the following exact specifications:

SLIDE SPECIFICATIONS

100%: #1A2332 (dark charcoal)
Texture overlay:

Subtle noise texture at 3% opacity across entire background

Optional accent (very subtle):

Thin white lines (0.5px width, 4% opacity) on right 30% of slide
Style: Abstract data flow lines, diagonal, non-distracting
Purpose: Suggests data movement without competing with content
CONTENT ELEMENTS
1. LOGO (Top-Left)
Placeholder: [EXPANSO LOGO]

Position:

80px from top edge
80px from left edge
Specifications:

Maximum width: 280px (maintain aspect ratio)
Color treatment: Light/white version of logo for contrast against dark background
Format note: Should be vector/SVG for crispness or high-res PNG
Clearspace: Minimum 40px clear space around logo on all sides

2. COMPANY TAGLINE (Center, Upper-Middle)
Text: Control Your Data. Everywhere.

Typography:

Font: Modern sans-serif (Inter Semi-Bold, Helvetica Neue Bold, or SF Pro Display Semi-Bold)
Weight: Semi-bold (600)
Size: 84pt (112px)
Color: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
Letter spacing: -1.5% (tight, premium feel)
Line height: 1.1
Position:

Horizontal: Centered on slide (960px from left edge)
Vertical: 340px from top edge
Alignment: Center-aligned text
Effects:

Text shadow:
X-offset: 0px
Y-offset: 2px
Blur: 8px
Color: Black (#000000) at 25% opacity
Purpose: Subtle depth, improves legibility
Important note on punctuation:

The period after "Data" creates a deliberate pause
"Everywhere" should feel like a powerful statement after the pause
Maintain exact punctuation: Control Your Data. Everywhere.
3. THREE VALUE PILLARS (Center, Below Tagline)
Text (three separate lines, stacked):



Reduce platform costs by 50–70%.
Accelerate engineering velocity.
Deploy AI-ready infrastructure.
Typography:

Font: Same sans-serif family as tagline
Weight: Regular (400)
Size: 36pt (48px)
Color: Light gray (#D4D9E0)
Letter spacing: 0% (normal)
Line height: 1.5 (generous spacing between lines for readability)
Position:

Horizontal: Centered on slide
Vertical: 500px from top edge (160px below tagline)
Alignment: Center-aligned text
Maximum width: 1200px container
Visual treatment:

Each line should be clearly separated (line-height creates natural spacing)
All three lines equal visual weight
No bullets, no numbering - clean stacked format
Design rationale for word choice:

Avoids repeating "control" or "data" from tagline (word fatigue rule)
Avoids repeating "your" across pillars (word fatigue rule)
Each pillar uses distinct vocabulary: Reduce/Accelerate/Deploy
Maintains parallel structure through verb-first construction
4. OPTIONAL DIVIDER LINE (Between Tagline and Pillars)
Element: Horizontal line

Specifications:

Width: 140px
Height: 3px
Color: Electric cyan (#00D9FF)
Opacity: 60%
End caps: Rounded (2px border-radius)
Position:

Horizontal: Centered on slide
Vertical: 460px from top edge (between tagline and pillars)
Purpose: Visual separator, adds polish, draws eye down the hierarchy

Note: This is optional - can be omitted for cleaner minimalist look

5. FOOTER SECTION (Bottom)
Container:

Background: Slightly darker navy (#0D1622) than main gradient

DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW
Whitespace:

Approximately 65% of slide should be empty space
Creates premium feel, signals confidence
Prevents cognitive overload
Hierarchy:

Clear visual flow: Logo → Tagline → Pillars → Footer
Eye naturally moves top-to-bottom, center focus
No competing elements for attention
Contrast:

All text must be clearly readable from 20+ feet away
White on navy = 15.8:1 contrast ratio (exceeds WCAG AAA)
Light gray on navy = 12.2:1 contrast ratio (exceeds WCAG AAA)
Simplicity:

No decorative elements that don't serve the message
No busy patterns or competing visuals
Clean, professional, enterprise-grade aesthetic
Focus:

Primary focal point: "Control Your Data. Everywhere." tagline
Secondary focal point: Three value pillars
Everything else is supporting/contextual
WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE
Do NOT include:

Flow diagrams or data visualizations (save for solution slide)
Platform logos (Snowflake, Databricks, etc.) - too cluttered for title slide
Multiple competing headlines
Bullet points or numbered lists
Any text smaller than 19pt
Decorative icons or graphics
Additional taglines or positioning statements
Multiple CTAs or contact methods
ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
All text meets WCAG AAA contrast standards (7:1 minimum)
Clear typographic hierarchy through size and color
Logical reading order: top-to-bottom, center-aligned
No reliance on color alone to convey information
OUTPUT FORMAT
Deliver as:

High-resolution PNG (3840 × 2160px for retina/4K displays)
OR vector format (PDF, SVG) for maximum quality
Color profile: sRGB (for screen presentation)
File size: Optimized to under 5MB if raster format
DESIGN RATIONALE
Why this works for sales:

"Control Your Data. Everywhere." - Crisp brand promise, memorable, addresses distributed enterprise reality
Three distinct pillars - Address all buyer personas without word repetition (cost=CFO, velocity=Engineering, AI=CDO)
Clean hierarchy - Professional, enterprise-credible, confident
Generous whitespace - Signals premium positioning
No clutter - Respects audience intelligence, lets them focus on the message
Metric-free tagline - Saves bold claims (50-70% reduction) for proof slides where they have context
Competitive positioning:

Snowflake/Databricks: "Move your data to us" (centralized)
Expanso: "Control your data everywhere" (distributed, customer empowerment)
