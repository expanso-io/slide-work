LLM PROMPT: EXPANSO SLIDE 2 - PROBLEM STATEMENT (SALES DECK)
Generate a professional presentation problem slide for a sales deck with the following exact specifications:

SLIDE SPECIFICATIONS
Format: 16:9 widescreen presentation slide (1920px × 1080px) Safe margins: 80px from all edges Purpose: Establish the cost problem with visual impact - set up need for solution

BACKGROUND
Consistent with Slide 1:

Deep navy blue (#0A1628) to dark charcoal (#1A2332) diagonal gradient at 135° angle
Subtle noise texture at 3% opacity
Optional: Very subtle data flow lines (0.5px, white at 4% opacity) on right side
CONTENT ELEMENTS
1. HEADLINE (Top, Left-Aligned)
Text: Your Platforms Are Drowning in Garbage

Typography:

Font: Modern sans-serif (Inter Bold, Helvetica Neue Bold, or SF Pro Display Bold)
Weight: Bold (700)
Size: 60pt (80px)
Color: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
Letter spacing: -1%
Line height: 1.1
Position:

Horizontal: 80px from left edge (left-aligned, not centered)
Vertical: 100px from top edge
Design rationale:

Provocative, direct language (aligns with David's contrarian voice)
Left-aligned creates energy vs. static centered layout
Avoids repeating "data" from Slide 1 tagline (word fatigue rule)
2. PRIMARY VISUAL: DATA FLOW DIAGRAM (Center-Left)
Diagram Structure:

Create a vertical flow diagram showing three stages:

Stage 1: Sources (Top)

Label: "SOURCES" in small caps, 24pt, light gray (#B8BFC7)
Icons/placeholders: 4 simple geometric icons representing:
Edge devices (square icon)
Servers (rectangle icon)
Applications (circle icon)
IoT sensors (triangle icon)
Icon style: Simple line icons, 2px stroke, white at 60% opacity
Icon size: 48px × 48px each
Spacing: 40px between icons, arranged horizontally
Stage 2: Unfiltered Flow (Middle)

Large downward arrow: 120px wide, bold, white (#FFFFFF)
Arrow style: Thick solid arrow, not outline
Inside arrow or beside it: "100% VOLUME" text
Font: 32pt, bold, white
Below arrow: Cost indicator
5 dollar sign icons: 💰 or use "$" symbols
Size: 36pt each
Color: Bright yellow/gold (#FFD700)
Spacing: 20px between each symbol
Purpose: Visual metaphor for mounting costs
Stage 3: Platforms (Bottom)

Label: "YOUR PLATFORMS" in small caps, 24pt, light gray (#B8BFC7)
Platform logo placeholders (use actual logos if available):
[SNOWFLAKE LOGO] [DATABRICKS LOGO] [SPLUNK LOGO] [DATADOG LOGO]
Logo height: 40px each (maintain aspect ratios)
Spacing: 40px between logos
Color: Full color logos (not grayscale)
Below logos: Cost breakdown in small text (30pt, light gray):
"Ingestion • Storage • Compute • Egress"
Use bullet separators (•) between items
Diagram Position:

Horizontal: 80px from left edge to 800px (left 40% of slide)
Vertical: Centered in available space (200px from top to 800px from top)
Total diagram height: ~600px
Diagram Styling:

Clean, minimal, geometric
2-4px line weights for clarity
Generous spacing between elements
No decorative elements or shadows on diagram itself
3. KEY MESSAGE & BULLETS (Right Side)
Primary Statement:

Text: 70% of ingested data is never queried.

Typography:

Font: Same sans-serif, Bold weight (700)
Size: 48pt (64px)
Color: White (#FFFFFF) with cyan accent on "70%"
"70%" in electric cyan (#00D9FF)
Rest of text in white
Line height: 1.3
Position:

Horizontal: 840px from left edge (right 50% of slide)
Vertical: 240px from top edge
Supporting Bullets (Below Primary Statement):

Text (three bullets, stacked):



Bills growing 40% annually—insights aren't.
Engineering teams firefighting, not building.
$13M average cost of poor quality per year.
Typography:

Font: Same sans-serif, Regular weight (400)
Size: 32pt (42px)
Color: Light gray (#D4D9E0)
Line height: 1.6 (generous spacing)
Bullet style: Simple dots (•), cyan color (#00D9FF), 16pt
Position:

Horizontal: 840px from left edge (aligned with primary statement)
Vertical: 380px from top edge (140px below primary statement)
Spacing: 50px between each bullet
Design rationale:

No word repetition: "Bills" not "costs", "firefighting" not "maintaining", "quality" not "data"
Each bullet addresses different buyer persona (CFO, Engineering, CDO)
Metrics specific, not vague
Active language: "growing", "firefighting"
4. SOURCE ATTRIBUTION (Bottom, Small)
Text: Industry data: Gartner 2024, CIO Dive 2024

Typography:

Font: Same sans-serif, Regular weight (400)
Size: 19pt (25px)
Color: Dim gray (#8A95A3)
Style: Italic (optional, for attribution styling)
Position:

Horizontal: 80px from left edge
Vertical: 1000px from top edge (60px from bottom)
Purpose:

Third-party validation without cluttering main message
Small enough to not compete with primary content
Meets minimum 19pt font requirement for footer elements
LAYOUT STRUCTURE
Visual Balance:

Left 40%: Diagram (visual, spatial, shows problem flow)
Right 50%: Text (message, bullets, quantifies problem)
Bottom 10%: Attribution (credibility)
Focal Point Priority:

Primary: "70% of ingested data is never queried" (largest text, cyan accent)
Secondary: Diagram with dollar signs (visual metaphor)
Tertiary: Supporting bullets (context)
Whitespace:

~55-60% of slide is empty space
Generous margins (80px all sides)
Clear separation between diagram and text (40px gutter)
WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE
Do NOT include:

Emoji in body text (dollar signs in diagram are acceptable as visual metaphor)
Multiple competing diagrams
More than 3 supporting bullets
Text smaller than 19pt
Decorative elements or background patterns beyond specified subtle lines
Multiple statistics in footer (keep attribution simple)
Any repeated words from Slide 1 ("control", "everywhere")
DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Contrast & Hierarchy:

Bold headline grabs attention (60pt)
Large primary statement with cyan accent (48pt, color emphasis on "70%")
Supporting bullets smaller but still readable (32pt)
Clear visual separation between diagram (left) and message (right)
Simplicity:

One diagram, one primary message, three bullets
No clutter, no competing focal points
Diagram is functional, not decorative
Credibility:

Specific metrics (70%, 40%, $13M)
Third-party sources cited (Gartner, CIO Dive)
Platform logos create immediate recognition ("That's us!")
Emotional Impact:

Provocative headline: "Drowning in Garbage"
Visual metaphor: Dollar signs multiplying
Relatable pain: "Firefighting, not building"
ACCESSIBILITY
All text meets WCAG AAA standards (7:1 contrast minimum)
Diagram uses both color AND position to convey meaning (not color alone)
Clear reading order: Headline → Diagram → Primary statement → Bullets → Attribution
Platform logos should include alt text if interactive: "Snowflake logo", "Databricks logo", etc.
OUTPUT FORMAT
High-resolution PNG (3840 × 2160px) or vector format (PDF, SVG)
Color profile: sRGB
File size: Under 5MB if raster
DESIGN RATIONALE
Why this structure works:

Provocative headline - "Drowning in Garbage" is memorable, direct, aligns with contrarian brand voice
Visual + Verbal - Diagram shows problem spatially, text quantifies impact
Left-right layout - Creates energy vs. static centered layouts
Specific metrics - 70%, 40%, $13M make pain tangible
Multi-persona appeal - Cost (CFO), operations (Engineering), quality (CDO)
Platform logos - Immediate recognition, creates "that's us" moment
No word fatigue - Avoids repeating "data", "control", "your" from Slide 1
Presentation flow:

Slide 1 established promise: "Control Your Data. Everywhere."
Slide 2 establishes problem: "You can't control it now—here's why"
Slide 3 will show solution: "Here's how we give you that control"
ALTERNATIVE HEADLINE OPTIONS
If "Drowning in Garbage" feels too aggressive for specific audiences:

Option A (Outcome-focused): Your Platforms Cost 40% More Every Year Option B (Empathy-driven): You Built Everything Right. Bills Doubled Anyway. Option C (Question format): Why Do Your Cloud Bills Keep Growing?

Recommended: Use "Drowning in Garbage" for sales decks. It's memorable and creates urgency.
