Deployment is gradual (canary rollout). And we have 99.9% uptime SLA. In 50+ production customers, we've never caused a production incident.",

(2) We work upstream—before platforms, not instead of them. (3) We reduce ALL platforms simultaneously, not just one. When you evaluate alternatives, compare our ROI model to their per-GB pricing.",
