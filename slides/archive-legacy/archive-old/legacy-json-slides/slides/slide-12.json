Routed only production-critical data to Snowflake. [Point to results] 68% cost reduction—$816K in annual savings. Took 3 weeks from shadow mode to production. Payback in 2.5 months. Plus their data quality improved—cleaner production tables. [Point to quote] Their VP of Data Engineering said: 'Expanso paid for itself in 10 weeks.

Filtered diagnostic logs in real-time. Routed only anomalies and errors to Splunk and Datadog. Archived full logs to S3 for compliance. [Point to results] 72% cost reduction—$2.02M in annual savings. 65% reduction in network bandwidth and egress costs. 40% reduction in mean time to recovery because less noise means faster debugging. And compliance was maintained with full 7-day archive in S3.

[Point to solution] We deployed Expanso at the data ingestion layer. Time-windowed filtering—last 90 days for ML. Masked PII before Databricks ingestion. Routed full transaction history to S3 for compliance. [Point to results] 58% cost reduction—$480K in annual savings. 35% reduction in model training time because of smaller, cleaner datasets.
