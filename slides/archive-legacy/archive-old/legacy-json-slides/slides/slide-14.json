              "question": "Does this work with my existing tools?",
              "answer": "Yes. Expanso sits upstream of your existing ETL/ELT tools (Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt) and cloud platforms (Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog). Nothing changes downstream—same queries, same dashboards, same APIs. We just reduce the volume of data reaching them.",

            {
              "question": "What if I filter out data I need later?",
              "answer": "We run in shadow mode first (1-2 weeks) to validate what would be filtered. You approve every filtering rule. Plus, filtered data can be archived to S3 at $0.02/GB for retrieval if ever needed. We use conservative filters by default—better to keep 10% too much than filter 1% too much.",

            {
              "question": "How long does deployment take?",
              "answer": "Pilot: 2-4 weeks (shadow mode → validation → go live). Production: 4-6 weeks for full rollout across all data sources. Most customers see first savings within 72 hours of going live.",

            },
            {
              "question": "Do I need to change my application code?",
              "answer": "No. Expanso taps existing data streams (log collectors, database change feeds, event buses). Your applications continue working exactly as they do today. Developers see no changes. Zero code modifications required.",

            },
            {
              "question": "What happens if Expanso goes down?",
              "answer": "Fail-open design: If an agent crashes or policy fails, data flows through unchanged. No data loss. No production impact. Your platforms continue receiving data as if Expanso wasn't there. We have 99.9% uptime SLA, but even in the 0.1%, your operations are unaffected.",

No data is transmitted to Expanso SaaS. Agents run entirely in your infrastructure. SOC 2 Type II certified. GDPR compliant. HIPAA-ready with BAA available.",
