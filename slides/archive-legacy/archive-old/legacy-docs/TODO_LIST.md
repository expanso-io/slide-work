- **Design system MUST be followed** - Colors, fonts, spacing are specified
- **Start with test slides** - Create 1-2 first to verify before full batch
- **Iterate as needed** - Adjust based on David's feedback
- **Keep it simple** - Draft quality first, refinement later
- **Claude Desktop has Figma MCP** - Ready to use immediately
