## FAQ

### Q: What's the most important document to read first?
**A:** For decision makers: RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md. For developers: SLIDEV_QUICK_REFERENCE.md.

### Q: How long does implementation take?
**A:** 4-6 weeks with a dedicated developer, or 8-12 weeks with part-time effort.

### Q: What's the biggest risk?
**A:** Team learning curve. Mitigated by training, documentation, and starting simple.
