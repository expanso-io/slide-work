Architecture review to determine where to deploy agents. Define success criteria—your target percentage reduction. And scope the pilot—we'll pick 1 to 2 data sources to start with. Participants: Sales, solutions engineering, your architects. Output: A pilot plan document.",
      "phase_2": "[Point to phase 2] Weeks two and three are the pilot deployment in shadow mode. We install agents—Kubernetes, Docker, or VM—your choice. Shadow mode is enabled—agents observe but don't modify anything. We collect baseline metrics for 2 weeks. And we develop policies—the filter, transform, and route rules. Participants: Solutions engineering and your DevOps or SRE team. Output: A savings analysis report. Milestone: We validate that 50 to 70% reduction is achievable.",
      "phase_3": "[Point to phase 3] Week four is validation and business case. We deliver a savings report with the actual percentage reduction measured. Query validation to confirm no data was lost. ROI calculation—a 3-year financial model. And a go/no-go decision meeting. Participants: Your exec sponsor, finance, and engineering. Output: Business case approval. This is a decision point.",
      "phase_4": "[Point to phase 4] Weeks five and six are production rollout. We flip from shadow to active mode. Canary rollout—10% traffic, then 50%, then 100%. Monitoring setup—dashboards and alerts. And we scale to additional data sources—2 to 10 sources depending on complexity. Participants: Solutions engineering, your SRE, and operations. Output: Production environment live. Milestone: First savings realized.",
      "phase_5": "[Point to phase 5] Weeks seven and eight are optimization and expansion. Policy tuning based on production data. Scale to remaining data sources—all sources.
