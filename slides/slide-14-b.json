Example: Reduce Snowflake spend from $1M → $400K. Gross savings: $600K. Our fee (at 25%): $150K. Your net savings: $450K. Measured quarterly via your platform bills.",

Independent audit: You can verify via your own platform dashboards. Quarterly reconciliation: True-up based on actual bills. Disputes: Third-party audit firm (you choose) as tiebreaker.",

Savings measured against 'what you WOULD have paid without Expanso' (baseline × growth factor), not absolute reduction. You're protected from paying us for your business growth.",

But: We won't go below 10% (not sustainable for us) or above 35% (not fair to you). Typical range: 18-25% for mid-market, 15-20% for enterprise.",

Option 2: Use FinOps/optimization budget. Option 3: Fund from Q1 savings (we defer payment until Q2). Most CFOs approve because ROI is immediate and measurable.",

You keep all savings achieved to date. Agents can be shut off immediately (data flows unchanged). Data export: Full lineage provided in 7 days.",

After 90 days: Pro-rated refund if terminating for cause. No refund for convenience termination. SLA credits: Automatic fee credits if we miss uptime commitments.",

(5) ROI: (Y-Z)/Z × 100%. (6) Payback: ~4 months. (7) 3-year NPV: $ABC. We provide Excel model with your actual numbers. CFOs love it because it's measurable and risk-free.",
