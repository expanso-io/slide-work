## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
Visual Layout:
Background: Clean, professional gradient (dark navy blue fading to deep charcoal) OR solid dark background with subtle data flow pattern overlay

Logo: Expanso logo in top-left corner (standard positioning)

Primary Headline (Large, Bold, Center-Aligned):


The Upstream Data Platform That Cuts
Cloud Data Costs by 50–70%
Font: Sans-serif, bold weight, ~48-60pt
Color: White or bright cyan (high contrast)
Positioning: Upper third of slide, centered

Subheadline (Medium Weight, Directly Below):


Filter, transform, and govern data at the source—
before it hits Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, or Datadog
Font: Sans-serif, regular or light weight, ~24-32pt
Color: Light gray or soft white (slightly muted vs. headline)
Positioning: Centered, 1-2 lines below headline

Optional Visual Element (Subtle, Non-Competing):
A simple, clean diagram showing data flow:



[Data Sources] → [EXPANSO] → [Platform Logos: Snowflake | Databricks | Splunk | Datadog]
                    ↓
             "50-70% Less Data"
Style: Minimalist line diagram, icons only, muted colors
Positioning: Center or lower-center of slide
Purpose: Reinforce spatial "upstream" concept without cluttering

Bottom Section (Standard Contact Info):


David Aronchick, CEO
aronchick@expanso.io
Font: Small (~14-16pt), light weight
Color: Medium gray
Positioning: Bottom-left or centered at bottom

Optional Tagline (Small, Subtle):


Expanso: Upstream Data Control
Font: ~12-14pt, light weight
Color: Muted gray
Positioning: Bottom-right corner
Purpose: Reinforce category positioning without overwhelming

Design Notes:
Color Palette:
Primary: Dark navy/charcoal background
Accent: Bright cyan or electric blue (for "Upstream" and key words)
Text: White (headlines), light gray (subtext)
Logos: Full color for platform logos (Snowflake, Databricks, etc.)
Typography Hierarchy:
Hero Statement: Largest, boldest ("The Upstream Data Platform...")
Value Prop: Medium, clear ("Filter, transform, govern...")
Contact: Smallest, unobtrusive
Visual Balance:
Top 40%: Headline + Subheadline
Middle 40%: Optional data flow diagram
Bottom 20%: Contact info + tagline
Why This Works:
✅ Outcome-First
"50-70% cost reduction" immediately grabs CFO/FinOps attention

✅ Spatial Positioning
"Upstream" + "before it hits" establishes your unique market position

✅ Platform Name-Drops
Mentioning Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog:

Makes it immediately relevant to your ICP
Positions you as complementary (not competitive)
Creates pattern interrupt ("Wait, you work WITH Snowflake?")
✅ Clean & Professional
No clutter, no jargon, no confusion—just a clear value statement

Alternative Version (If Presenting to Technical Audience):
Primary Headline:



The Missing Control Layer in the Modern Data Stack
Subheadline:



Process data at the source. Cut volumes 50-70%.
Reduce platform costs. Automate compliance.
When to Use: Technical conferences, architect/engineer audiences, developer-focused events

When NOT to Use: Executive presentations, CFO/FinOps audiences (lead with business outcomes instead)

Presentation Tips:
Opening Line (When Presenting):
"Today I'm going to show you how to cut your cloud data costs by 50 to 70 percent—without losing a single insight. We do this by controlling data upstream, before it hits your expensive platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, or Datadog."

Pause After Title Slide:
Let the "50-70%" number land. Don't rush to the next slide. This creates intrigue and gives the audience time to process the bold claim.

Transition to Slide 2:
"Now, I know what you're thinking: 'That sounds too good to be true.' So let me show you why your cloud bills keep growing—and why traditional approaches can't fix it."

This slide sets the stage for your entire narrative: Problem → Diagnosis → Solution → Proof.

Color Palette:
Background: Dark navy or charcoal (consistent with Slide 1)
Title: White or bright cyan
Diagram Elements:
Data sources: Light gray icons
Arrow: Bold white or cyan
"Unfiltered Data" box: Dark red or orange (warning color)
Dollar signs: Bright yellow or gold ($$$ = cost)
Platform logos: Full color
Key Messages: White text with accent colors on percentages
Stats Bar: Muted gray text
Why This Slide Works:
✅ Visual Impact
The diagram immediately shows the problem: data flows unfiltered into expensive platforms

✅ Concrete Numbers
"60-70%", "40% YoY", "$13M" make the pain tangible and measurable

✅ Multi-Persona Appeal
CFO/FinOps: Sees cost problem (40% growth, $13M waste)
Data Engineers: Sees operational pain (40% time firefighting)
CDO: Sees strategic risk (unused data, no ROI)
✅ Third-Party Validation
Gartner and CIO Dive citations prove this isn't just "your" problem—it's industry-wide

✅ Sets Up Your Solution
By showing data flowing FROM sources TO platforms, you're priming the audience for the "what if we controlled it BEFORE it arrives?" insight on Slide 3

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"Let me show you why your cloud bills keep growing—and why you can't fix it with your current architecture."

Point to Diagram:
"Here's what's happening: All your data—from edge devices, servers, applications, IoT sensors—flows directly into your cloud platforms. [Pause] No filtering. No optimization. No control."

Point to Dollar Signs:
"And you pay at every stage: Ingestion costs. Storage costs. Compute costs. Egress costs. It's what we call the '$10M Data Tax.'"

Point to Key Messages:
"Here's the kicker: 60 to 70 percent of the data sitting in Snowflake is never queried. You're paying to store and process data you'll never use. [Pause]

Your Snowflake bill grows 40% year-over-year, but your insights don't. And your data teams? They spend 40% of their time firefighting broken pipelines instead of building new capabilities."

Point to Stats Bar:
"And this isn't just anecdotal. Gartner reports that data quality issues cost the average enterprise $13 million annually. CIO Dive found that 62% of enterprises report storage cost overruns. This is an industry-wide crisis."

Transition to Slide 3:
"So why does this happen? Because the modern data stack is missing a critical layer. Let me show you..."

Design Tips:
Keep It Simple:
Don't overload with too many icons or elements
The flow should be instantly readable: Sources → Data → Platforms → $$$$
Use Animation (Optional):
If presenting live, consider simple animations:

Step 1: Show data sources
Step 2: Arrow appears with "100% Volume"
Step 3: Dollar signs multiply
Step 4: Platform logos appear
Step 5: Key messages fade in
Warning: Only use animation if presenting live. For PDF decks, use static version.

Make Platform Logos Recognizable:
Use the actual Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog logos—your audience will immediately recognize them and think, "That's us!"

Alternative Version (More Empathy-Driven):
If you want to validate their past decisions first:

Title:


You've Done Everything Right—And Your Bills Still Doubled
Body:


✅ You invested in best-in-class platforms
   [Logos: Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog]

✅ You hired talented data teams

✅ You centralized data for a "single source of truth"

❌ But your cloud data bills grew 40% YoY

❌ Your pipelines are brittle and break constantly

❌ Your best engineers spend 60% of time firefighting
Bottom Line (Bold):


The problem isn't your tools. It's your architecture.
When to Use This Version:

Defensive audiences who've already invested heavily
Presentations to teams that might feel criticized
When you need to build trust before challenging their approach
Final Recommendation:
Use the diagram-focused version for most audiences. It's visual, clear, and immediately communicates the problem without words.

Save the empathy-driven version for audiences that might be defensive about their current stack.

Next Step: Slide 3 should introduce the root cause (downstream-only architecture) before Slide 4 introduces your solution category ("Upstream Data Control").


## SLIDE 3: The Root Cause
Slide Title (Bold, Top):


The Root Cause: Downstream-Only Architecture
Font: Sans-serif, bold, ~36-42pt
Color: White or bright accent color
Positioning: Top of slide, left-aligned or centered

Primary Message (Large, Centered):


For decades, best practice was:
Collect ALL data → Move it to a central location → Process it there

This made sense when data was small and centralized.

Today? It's the most expensive way to operate.
Font: Sans-serif, medium weight, ~22-26pt
Color: White with key phrases in accent color
Positioning: Upper-center of slide
Style: Clean line breaks, emphasize the OLD workflow

Why This Slide Works:
✅ Validates the Past
"This made sense when data was small" → You're not calling them stupid, you're saying the world changed

✅ Identifies the Structural Problem
It's not about tools or people—it's about architecture

✅ Introduces "Data Tax" Concept
Memorable metaphor that you'll reference throughout the deck

✅ Visual Simplicity
The "missing layer" diagram is instantly understandable

✅ Sets Up Your Solution
By showing the GAP, you create the need for Slide 4 (introducing Expanso as the solution)

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"So why does this problem exist? It's not because you made bad decisions. It's because the architecture that worked for 20 years no longer works today."

Point to Message:
"For decades, best practice was simple: Collect all your data, move it to a central location—your data warehouse or data lake—and process it there. [Pause]

And that made perfect sense when data volumes were measured in gigabytes, when everything was centralized, and when you could predict your costs."

Transition to "Today":
"But today? Data volumes are measured in terabytes or petabytes. Data comes from everywhere—edge devices, cloud applications, IoT sensors. And costs? They're completely unpredictable and growing 40% year-over-year."

Point to Diagram:
"Here's the structural problem: The modern data stack has no control layer. [Pause]

Data flows from your sources directly into expensive downstream platforms. There's no filtering. No optimization. No governance at the source. Everything just... moves."

Point to "Data Tax":
"And that means every single byte you touch forces you to pay what we call a 'Data Tax.' You pay to transfer it. You pay to store it. You pay to compute on it. Whether it's valuable or not."

Closing:
"By the time your data lands in Snowflake or Databricks, the financial damage is already done. You can't optimize your way out of this problem downstream. [Pause]

You need to solve it upstream."

Transition to Slide 4:
"So what's the solution? You need a control layer—something that sits between your sources and your platforms. Let me show you what that looks like..."

When to Use This Version:

More confrontational audiences who need to be challenged
Technical audiences who appreciate directness
When you want to create more cognitive dissonance
Design Tips:
Keep the Focus on Architecture, Not Tools:
Don't criticize Snowflake, Databricks, etc. directly
Frame it as: "These platforms are great—but they're downstream. The problem is upstream."
Use the "Missing Layer" Visual:
The gap in the architecture should be visually obvious
Use a red X or warning color to highlight the missing control layer
Emphasize the Inevitability:
"By the time data lands in the cloud, the damage is done" → Creates urgency
Connect to Slide 2:
Reference the "$10M Data Tax" from Slide 2
Show that the root cause (no control layer) creates the symptoms (runaway costs)
Animation Options (If Presenting Live):
Step 1: Show "The Old World vs. Today" comparison
Step 2: Fade in the architecture diagram
Step 3: Highlight the "NO CONTROL" gap with red box
Step 4: Show dollar signs multiplying downstream
Step 5: Final message appears: "By the time data lands..."
Warning: Only use animation for live presentations. Static version for PDF decks.

Key Messaging Points:
✅ DO Say:
"The architecture that worked for 20 years doesn't work today"
"The modern data stack is missing a control layer"
"Every byte you touch forces you to pay a Data Tax"
"By the time data lands downstream, the damage is done"
❌ DON'T Say:
"Your tools are bad" (you need them as partners)
"You made the wrong decisions" (creates defensiveness)
"Just use less data" (oversimplifies the problem)
Transition to Slide 4:
This slide diagnoses the root cause (no control layer).

Slide 4 should introduce the solution category ("Upstream Data Control") before you introduce Expanso specifically.

The narrative arc is:

Slide 2: Problem (symptoms)
Slide 3: Root cause (diagnosis)
Slide 4: Solution category (new way of thinking)
Slide 5: Your product (Expanso as the definitive solution)
Would you like me to create Slide 4 now? (Introducing "Upstream Data Control" as the solution category)

Why This Slide Works:
✅ Introduces the Solution Category First
You're not selling Expanso yet—you're selling the concept of upstream control

✅ Visual Contrast
The before/after or flow diagram makes the solution instantly understandable

✅ Shows the Mechanism
Three clear pillars (Filter, Transform, Govern) explain HOW it works

✅ Quantifies the Outcome
"50-70% cost reduction" ties back to your opening promise

✅ Multiplier Effect
"Filter once upstream → Save everywhere downstream" shows compounding value

✅ Sets Up Expanso
By establishing the category, Slide 5 can position Expanso as the definitive solution

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"So here's the solution: Upstream Data Control. [Pause]

Instead of moving all your data downstream and dealing with the consequences, you control it upstream—at the source—before it ever hits your expensive platforms."

Point to Diagram:
"Here's what that looks like architecturally. Data still flows from your sources—edge devices, cloud applications, IoT sensors. But now, there's a control layer sitting upstream."

Point to Three Pillars:
"This control layer does three things:

First, it filters. It eliminates 50 to 70 percent of the noise—duplicate events, unnecessary logs, data you'll never query. Only valuable data moves downstream.

Second, it transforms. It optimizes, enriches, and structures data before it moves. So when it arrives at Snowflake or Databricks, it's already ready to use. No more expensive compute just to clean your data.

Third, it governs. It detects PII, masks sensitive data, and enforces compliance policies at the source. Before data leaves your trusted environment."

Point to Outcome:
"The result? Instead of 100% of your data hitting expensive platforms, only 30% arrives. And that means 50 to 70 percent cost reduction."

Emphasize Multiplier Effect:
"And here's the kicker: You filter once upstream, and you save everywhere downstream. Snowflake gets less data. Databricks gets less data. Splunk gets less data. Datadog gets less data. S3 storage costs drop. Every platform in your stack becomes cheaper."

Transition to Slide 5:
"Now, this isn't theoretical. We've built this. It's called Expanso. Let me show you how it works..."

When to Use This Version:

Technical/architect audiences who appreciate paradigm shifts
When positioning against "modern data stack" vendors
Industry conferences where you want thought leadership positioning
Design Tips:
Make the Control Layer Visually Distinct:
Use a bright accent color (cyan, green) to make it stand out
Add a subtle glow or border to emphasize it's the key innovation
Position it clearly BETWEEN sources and platforms
Show the Math:
"100% data → 30% data = 70% savings" should be crystal clear
Use visual size differences (large arrow before, small arrow after)
Use Icons Consistently:
🔍 = Filter (throughout the deck)
⚡ = Transform (throughout the deck)
🔒 = Govern (throughout the deck)
This creates visual consistency and memory anchors
Emphasize "Before":
Highlight the word "BEFORE" in every mention
This reinforces your spatial positioning (upstream vs. downstream)
Animation Options (If Presenting Live):
Step 1: Show sources and platforms (current state)
Step 2: Fade in the control layer between them
Step 3: Highlight each pillar (Filter → Transform → Govern)
Step 4: Show data volume shrinking (100% → 30%)
Step 5: Show cost reduction (💰💰💰💰💰 → 💰💰)
Step 6: Final message: "50-70% cost reduction"
Warning: Only use animation for live presentations. Static version for PDF decks.

Key Messaging Points:
✅ DO Say:
"Upstream Data Control" (establish the category)
"Control data BEFORE it hits expensive platforms"
"Filter once upstream, save everywhere downstream"
"This is the missing layer in the modern data stack"
"50-70% cost reduction across your entire data estate"
❌ DON'T Say:
"Replace your current tools" (you're complementary)
"Stop using Snowflake/Databricks" (you make them better)
"This is just data transformation" (undersells the platform value)
Connection to Your Positioning Document:
This slide directly implements your recommended positioning:

Icon Usage Guide:
Consistent Icons Throughout Deck:
🔍 Filter = Magnifying glass (represents finding what matters)
⚡ Transform = Lightning bolt (represents speed/power)
🔒 Govern = Lock (represents security/compliance)
✅ Success = Checkmark (represents solution/positive outcome)
❌ Problem = X mark (represents gap/issue)
💰 Cost = Dollar signs (represents financial impact)
Design Note: Consider replacing emoji with custom icons in your brand colors for a more professional look

Color Psychology Applied:
Problem Colors (Slides 2-3):
Red/Orange = Warning, cost, danger
Used for: "NO CONTROL", dollar signs (problem state)
Solution Colors (Slide 4+):
Cyan/Blue = Trust, intelligence, technology
Green = Success, savings, positive outcome
Used for: Control layer, checkmarks, savings
Neutral Colors:
Dark navy/charcoal = Background (professional, stable)
White/light gray = Text (clarity, readability)
Platform logos = Full color (recognition, partnership)
Mobile/Print Considerations:
If this deck will be:

Emailed as PDF: Ensure all text is readable at 50% zoom
Printed: Use high-contrast colors (avoid subtle grays)
Viewed on mobile: Keep text size 16pt minimum, avoid tiny icons
A/B Testing Recommendations:
If you're presenting to multiple audiences, test these variations:

Version A: Outcome-First
Lead with "50-70% cost reduction"
Show ROI math
Best for: CFO, FinOps, Economic Buyers
Version B: Architecture-First
Lead with "The missing layer in the modern data stack"
Show technical diagram
Best for: CTOs, Architects, Technical Champions
Version C: Problem-First
Lead with "Stop paying the Data Tax"
Emphasize pain points
Best for: VPs of Data, Platform Engineering Directors
Recommendation: Default to Version A (Outcome-First) for cold audiences, Version B (Architecture-First) for technical deep-dives

Slide 4 Summary:
Purpose: Establish "Upstream Data Control" as the solution category
Key Message: Control data BEFORE it hits expensive platforms
Visual Strategy: Show the control layer sitting between sources and platforms
Outcome: 50-70% cost reduction through intelligent filtering, transformation, and governance
Next Step: Slide 5 introduces Expanso as the definitive upstream data platform

What Makes This Slide Effective:
✅ Category Creation
You're not just selling a product—you're introducing a new way of thinking about data architecture

✅ Visual Clarity
The diagram is instantly understandable: Sources → Control → Platforms

✅ Three Mechanisms
Filter, Transform, Govern—clear, memorable, actionable

✅ Quantified Value
50-70% isn't vague—it's tied to specific mechanisms (filtering volume)

✅ Multiplier Effect
Shows why the savings are so dramatic (one filter saves across ALL platforms)

✅ Platform-Agnostic
Works with Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog—not replacing them

Common Questions This Slide Answers:
Q: "How is this different from ETL tools?"
A: Built into the slide—"Transform intelligently BEFORE it moves" (not after)

Q: "Won't this add latency?"
A: Built into the slide—"4x faster time-to-insight" (processing at source is faster)

Q: "Do we need to rip and replace our stack?"
A: Built into the slide—Shows your platforms (❄️ 🧱 🔥 🐶) still in place

Q: "How much will this really save us?"
A: Built into the slide—"Every GB filtered = $100+ saved"

Presentation Tips for This Slide:
Pace Yourself:
This is a critical pivot slide—don't rush through it. Spend 2-3 minutes here.

Use the "Pause and Point" Technique:
Point to sources: "Data starts here..."
Point to control layer: "Now there's a control layer..."
Point to platforms: "So only valuable data arrives here..."
Point to outcome: "Result: 50 to 70 percent cost reduction"
Anticipate Skepticism:
If you see skeptical faces, address it directly:

"I know this sounds too good to be true. So let me show you exactly how we do this and prove it with real customer results..."

Then transition confidently to Slide 5.

│     • Optimize, enrich, structure before movement           │
│     • Reduce downstream compute costs                       │

Accessibility Considerations:
For Color-Blind Audiences:
Don't rely solely on red/green for problem/solution
Use icons (❌ vs ✅) in addition to colors
Use patterns or textures to differentiate elements
For Screen Readers:
Add alt text to all diagrams
Ensure text hierarchy is clear (H1, H2, H3)
For Low-Vision:
Minimum 16pt font size
High contrast (white on dark, or dark on white)
Avoid light gray on white
File Formats & Delivery:
For Live Presentation:
PowerPoint/Keynote: Use animations sparingly
PDF: Static version, no animations
Web: Consider interactive HTML version
For Email/Follow-Up:
PDF: High-quality export (300 DPI)
Include notes: Add presenter notes as appendix
One-pager: Create condensed version for executives
Metrics to Track (If A/B Testing):
Engagement Metrics:
Time spent on this slide (should be 2-3 minutes)
Questions asked (indicates interest/confusion)
Note-taking behavior (indicates value)
Comprehension Metrics:
Can audience explain "upstream data control" back to you?
Do they understand the three pillars?
Do they grasp the multiplier effect?
Conversion Metrics:
% who request demo after seeing this slide
% who mention "upstream" in follow-up conversations
% who share the deck internally
Common Mistakes to Avoid:
❌ Mistake 1: Too Much Text
Don't turn this into a wall of text. Keep it visual.

❌ Mistake 2: Skipping This Slide
Don't jump straight to Expanso. Establish the category first.

❌ Mistake 3: Underselling the Impact
Don't say "reduce costs"—say "50-70% cost reduction"

❌ Mistake 4: Overcomplicating the Visual
Don't add too many arrows, boxes, or elements. Keep it simple.

❌ Mistake 5: Forgetting the "Why"
Don't just show HOW it works—show WHY it matters (multiplier effect)

Follow-Up Materials to Prepare:
After presenting this slide, have ready:

1. Technical Deep-Dive Deck

│  │  1. Deploy lightweight agents at your data sources    │ │
│  │     • Edge devices, servers, cloud apps, IoT          │ │
│  │     • No disruption to existing pipelines             │ │
│  │                                                        │ │
│  │  2. Define policies in simple, declarative config     │ │
│  │     • Filter rules: "Drop logs with level=DEBUG"      │ │
│  │     • Transform rules: "Enrich with geo-IP data"      │ │

Purpose: Address enterprise buying criteria (security, scale, support)

Color Palette:
Background: Dark navy/charcoal (consistent)
Title: Bright cyan/electric blue (Expanso brand color)
Expanso Box: Highlighted with cyan border or subtle glow
Icons:
💰 = Gold/yellow (cost savings)
🚀 = Blue (speed/acceleration)
🤖 = Purple/magenta (AI/ML)
🔍 = Blue (filter)
⚡ = Yellow (transform)
🔒 = Green (govern)
Platform Logos: Full color
Checkmarks: Bright green (✅)
Why This Slide Works:
✅ Category-to-Product Bridge
Slide 4 established "upstream data control"—now you show Expanso IS that solution

✅ Visual Continuity
Same diagram structure as Slide 4, but now branded as Expanso

✅ Three-Pillar Consistency
Maps directly to your positioning doc (Control, Accelerate, AI/ML)

✅ Outcome-Focused
Every feature ties to a business outcome (50-70% savings, 4x faster, etc.)

✅ De-Risks the Decision
"Works with existing tools" + "Deploy in days" = low-risk adoption

✅ Enterprise Credibility
SOC 2, scale, support = addresses enterprise buying concerns

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"So let me introduce you to Expanso—the upstream data platform that makes all of this real."

Point to Diagram:
"Expanso sits right here—[point to control layer]—upstream of your data stack. Between your sources and your platforms."

Explain How It Works:
"Here's how it works in practice:

First, filtering. Expanso uses policy-driven rules to eliminate 50 to 70 percent of unnecessary data at the source. Duplicate logs, debug-level events, data you'll never query—gone before it ever hits the network.

Second, transformation. Expanso optimizes, enriches, and structures your data in real-time, at the edge. So when it arrives at Snowflake or Databricks, it's already clean and ML-ready. No more expensive compute just to prepare your data.

Third, governance. Expanso automatically detects and masks PII and PHI before data leaves your environment. It maintains complete lineage from source to destination. Compliance by design, not by retrofit."

Point to Outcomes:
"What does this deliver?

Control your data. 50 to 70 percent reduction in platform costs. Intelligent tiering—high-value data goes to expensive platforms, low-value data goes to cheap storage like S3.

Accelerate your teams. 90 percent reduction in pipeline troubleshooting. Data onboarding goes from 6 months to 2 weeks. Your engineers focus on building, not firefighting.

Unlock AI and ML. Real-time feature engineering at the edge. ML-ready datasets, not raw dumps. Global model orchestration across your entire fleet."

De-Risk:
"And here's the best part: Expanso works with your existing stack. [Point to platform logos] You're not ripping and replacing Snowflake or Databricks or Splunk. You're making them cheaper, faster, and more effective. You can deploy Expanso in days, not months."

Transition to Next Slide:
"Now let me show you this in action with a real customer example..."

Why This Slide Works:
✅ Concrete Proof
Real numbers ($2.8M → $900K) validate your 50-70% savings claim

✅ Relatable Profile
"Financial Services, 2,500 employees, $500M revenue" helps prospects self-identify

✅ Multi-Dimensional Value
Shows cost savings + operational improvements + compliance + business outcomes

✅ Before/After Clarity
Visual comparison makes the transformation instantly understandable

✅ Specific Mechanisms
Shows exactly HOW the savings were achieved (filter 67%, intelligent routing, etc.)

✅ Business Context
"Freed up $1.9M for AI/ML initiatives" shows strategic impact beyond cost cutting

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"Now let me show you this in action with a real customer. This is a financial services company—2,500 employees, about $500 million in revenue. Very similar profile to many of you in the room."

The Challenge:
"They had a classic problem: Their Snowflake bill was $2.8 million annually and growing 40% year-over-year. When they looked at the data, 65% of what they were ingesting into Snowflake was never queried. Never used. But they were paying for all of it—ingestion, storage, compute."

The Solution:
"They deployed Expanso in two weeks. We installed lightweight agents on their application servers and defined a set of filtering policies. [Point to policies]

Drop DEBUG and TRACE level logs—that eliminated 45% of the volume right there. Deduplicate redundant events—another 15%. Sample low-priority metrics instead of sending everything—7% more. Total: 67% of their data volume was filtered at the source.

High-value data still went to Snowflake. Low-value data was routed to S3 for long-term archive at 95% lower cost. And we automatically detected and masked PII before any data left their environment."

The Results:
"[Point to After box] The results were dramatic. Their Snowflake bill went from $2.8 million to $900,000 annually. That's $1.9 million saved per year. 67% cost reduction. And the payback period? 45 days.

But it wasn't just about cost. Their queries got 3x faster because there was less data to scan. Data onboarding went from 6 months to 2 weeks. Pipeline incidents dropped 93%—from 15 per month to 1 per month. And they achieved 100% PII masking at the source."

The Business Impact:
"Here's what's really powerful: They took that $1.9 million in savings and reinvested it into AI and machine learning initiatives. Their data team went from spending 60% of their time firefighting to 5%. The CFO was so impressed that he approved expansion to their Databricks pipelines. This became the model for other business units in the company."

The Quote:
"[Point to quote] And here's what their VP of Data Engineering told us: 'Expanso paid for itself in 45 days. We went from drowning in Snowflake bills to having budget for innovation.'"

Track: Which version generates most engagement, demo requests, follow-up questions

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
❌ Mistake 1: Too Much Text
Keep it visual—use the before/after diagram, not paragraphs

❌ Mistake 2: Vague Numbers
Don't say "significant savings"—say "$1.9M saved annually"

❌ Mistake 3: No Context
Always include customer profile so prospects can relate

❌ Mistake 4: Only Cost Focus
Show operational, compliance, and strategic benefits too

❌ Mistake 5: Unrealistic Claims
Use real numbers from real customers with attribution

Legal/Compliance Notes:
Customer Anonymization:
If customer requires anonymity:

Use "Fortune 500 FinTech Company" (no name)
Remove specific employee counts/revenue if sensitive
Get written approval for any quotes or metrics
Metric Accuracy:
Ensure all numbers are verified and documented
Include timeframe context ("annual savings")
Specify methodology if questioned
Competitive Claims:
Avoid naming competitors directly on this slide
Focus on customer outcomes, not competitive bashing

✅ Quick Payback
47-day average payback period reduces perceived risk

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"Now, that financial services example isn't unique. We're seeing consistent results across industries. Let me show you the pattern..."

Point to Grid:
"[Point to each box] Financial services: 67% savings on Snowflake. Healthcare: 72% savings on Splunk. E-commerce: 58% savings on Databricks. Manufacturing: 68% on IoT edge data. Automotive: 73% on connected vehicle telemetry.

The pattern is clear: Whether you're running Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, or Datadog—whether you're in finance, healthcare, retail, or manufacturing—the results are consistent. 50 to 70 percent cost reduction."

Point to Aggregate Results:
"[Point to bottom stats] Across all customers, we're averaging 62% cost reduction. We've delivered over $100 million in total savings. Average first-year ROI is 8.2x. And the average payback period is just 47 days—less than two months."

Address Skepticism:
"Now, I know what some of you might be thinking: 'This sounds too consistent. Are these numbers real?' Yes—and here's why the results are so consistent: [pause for emphasis]

We're not doing anything magical. We're simply filtering 50 to 70 percent of unnecessary data at the source. That's data you're currently paying to move, store, and process—but never actually use. When you eliminate that waste, the savings are mathematical, not magical."

Platform-Specific:
"And this works across platforms. [Point to platform results] Snowflake customers save 58 to 72 percent. Databricks customers save 54 to 68 percent. Splunk customers save 62 to 78 percent. In fact, Splunk customers often see the highest savings because observability data is particularly noisy."

Transition to Next Slide:
"So you've seen the proof—one detailed example and the pattern across industries. Now let me show you exactly how we'll deliver these results for you..."

Slide 7 Summary:
Purpose: Establish pattern of success across industries and platforms
Key Message: Consistent 50-70% savings is proven, not theoretical
Visual Strategy: Grid layout showing breadth of customer success
Proof Points: $100M+ savings, 62% average reduction, 95% retention
Next Step: Transition to implementation roadmap or enterprise readiness

What Makes This Slide Effective:
✅ Breadth of Proof
6 different industries = not a one-off success story

✅ Consistency Builds Credibility
All results in 50-70% range = predictable, reliable outcomes

✅ Platform Diversity
Shows it works with Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog = not platform-specific

✅ Multiple Entry Points
Different industries and platforms help various prospects self-identify

✅ Aggregate Metrics
$100M+ total savings and 95% retention = scale and staying power

✅ Social Proof
Customer logos (U.S. Navy, City of Las Vegas, Sunified) = credibility

✅ Fast ROI
47-day average payback = low financial risk

Presentation Best Practices:
Timing:
Recommended Time: 2-3 minutes
Don't rush through this—it's your credibility slide
Pause after showing the grid to let it sink in
Emphasis:
Highlight the consistency: "Notice the pattern..."
Point to specific industries that match your audience
Emphasize the aggregate metrics: "$100M+ delivered"
Interaction:
Ask: "Which of these industries is most similar to yours?"
Offer: "Would you like to speak with a customer in your industry?"
Gauge interest: "What platform are you currently using?"
Customization for Live Presentations:
If Prospect is Financial Services:
"I see you're in financial services. [Point to FinTech box] This customer profile is very similar to yours—2,500 employees, heavy Snowflake usage. They saved $1.9 million annually with a 45-day payback. Would you like me to connect you with their VP of Data Engineering?"

If Prospect Uses Snowflake:
"I see you're using Snowflake. [Point to multiple Snowflake customers] We have 12+ Snowflake customers who've achieved 58 to 72 percent cost reduction. That's over $25 million in total Snowflake savings across our customer base."

If Prospect is Skeptical:
"I know these numbers might sound too good to be true. That's why we have a 95% customer retention rate. [Point to stat] If customers weren't seeing real value, they wouldn't renew. And we're happy to arrange reference calls with customers in your industry."

Common Objections & Responses:
Objection: "Our situation is unique"
Response: "That's exactly what our healthcare customer said—until they saw a 72% reduction in Splunk costs. What makes your situation unique? Let's discuss how Expanso would adapt to your specific needs."

Objection: "We're smaller/larger than these examples"
Response: "These are representative examples. We have customers ranging from 500 to 50,000 employees. The savings percentage is consistent regardless of size—it's about the ratio of valuable to unnecessary data."

Objection: "We use different tools"
Response: [Point to platform list] "We work with Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog, BigQuery, and more. What platforms are you using? I can show you specific results for those."

Objection: "How do I know these numbers are real?"
Response: "Great question. Every number on this slide comes from actual customer deployments. We can provide detailed case studies, and I'm happy to arrange reference calls. In fact, would you like to speak with a customer in your industry this week?"

Follow-Up Actions After This Slide:
Immediate (During Presentation):
Offer reference customer call
Ask which industry/platform is most relevant
Gauge interest level ("Is this the kind of result you'd be interested in?")
Within 24 Hours:
Email industry-specific case study
Send customer reference contact info
Provide ROI calculator with prospect's numbers
Within 1 Week:
Schedule reference customer call
Send detailed technical documentation
Propose proof-of-concept or pilot
Metrics to Track:
If you're A/B testing different versions of this slide, track:

Engagement Metrics:
Time spent on slide (should be 2-3 minutes)
Questions asked (indicates interest)
Which industries get most attention
Conversion Metrics:
% who request reference calls after seeing this
% who ask about pricing/next steps
% who schedule follow-up meetings
Message Resonance:
Which metrics get mentioned in follow-up emails
Which industries prospects reference
Whether they repeat "50-70% savings" language
Legal & Compliance Notes:
Customer Anonymization:
If using real company names, get written approval
For anonymous examples, use "Fortune 500 FinTech" format
Ensure all metrics are accurate and documented
Metric Verification:
Keep backup documentation for all numbers
Include timeframe context (annual savings, first-year ROI)
Be prepared to explain methodology if questioned
Competitive Claims:
Avoid saying "better than [competitor]"
Focus on customer outcomes, not competitive bashing
If asked, have competitive battlecards ready separately
File Formats & Versions:
Standard Deck Version:
Use the recommended complete version above
Works for most enterprise sales situations
Executive Summary Version:
Remove individual industry cards
Focus on aggregate metrics only
1 slide instead of detailed grid
Technical Deep-Dive Version:
Add technical implementation details per industry
Include architecture diagrams
Show deployment patterns
Industry-Specific Versions:
Create custom versions highlighting relevant industry
Move that industry to top-left (prime position)
Add 2-3 more examples from same industry
FINAL SLIDE 7 CHECKLIST:
✅ Multiple industries shown: Financial, Healthcare, E-Commerce, Manufacturing, Automotive, Telecom
✅ Consistent savings range: All examples in 50-70% range
✅ Platform diversity: Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog represented

Presentation Timing Breakdown:
Total Time: 2-3 minutes

Introduction (20 sec): "Let me show you the pattern across industries..."
Grid walkthrough (60 sec): Point to each industry, emphasize consistency
Aggregate metrics (30 sec): "$100M+ delivered, 62% average..."
Platform diversity (20 sec): "Works with Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk..."
Social proof (10 sec): "Trusted by U.S. Navy, Fortune 500..."
Q&A/Discussion (20-40 sec): "Which industry is most relevant to you?"
Next Slide Recommendations:
Based on audience reaction to Slide 7:

If Audience is Convinced (Ready to Move Forward):
→ Slide 8: "Your Path to Success" (Implementation roadmap)

If Audience Needs More Confidence:
→ Slide 8: "Enterprise Ready" (Security, scale, support)

If Audience Wants to Discuss Money:
→ Slide 8: "Investment & ROI" (Pricing, ROI calculator)

If Audience is Technical:
→ Slide 8: "How Expanso Works" (Architecture deep-dive)

Slide 7 is now complete!

This slide establishes the pattern of success across industries and platforms, building credibility through breadth of proof. It shows that the 50-70% savings from Slide 6 isn't an outlier—it's consistent and repeatable.

Recommended next slide: "Your Path to 50-70% Savings" (Implementation Roadmap)

This would transition naturally from "Here's the proof" → "Here's how we'll deliver this for you"

Would you like me to create Slide 8 now? Which direction should we go:

Implementation Roadmap ("Your Path to Success")
Enterprise Readiness ("Built for Enterprise Scale")
Pricing & ROI ("Investment & Returns")
Call to Action ("Get Started")
Which makes most sense for your typical sales process?

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"So you've seen the proof. Now let me show you exactly how we'll deliver these results for you. This is our proven 90-day roadmap that's worked for every customer."

Phase 1 - Assess & Plan:
"[Point to Week 1-2] We start with a Data Value Assessment workshop. This is where we map your current data sources, analyze usage patterns, and identify the quick wins. By the end of Week 2, you'll have a clear ROI model showing exactly where your savings will come from, an architecture design, and an initial policy catalog.

The time commitment from your team is minimal—about 50% of a Data Platform Lead and 25% of a Data Engineer. That's it."

Phase 2 - Deploy & Validate:
"[Point to Week 3-4] In Weeks 3 and 4, we deploy to production. We start with 1 or 2 pilot data sources—not everything at once. We configure your filtering policies, test thoroughly, and then go live with zero downtime. [Pause for emphasis]

And here's what's important: [Point to Early Wins] Cost savings are visible in Week 1 of production. Not Week 4. Not Month 2. Week 1. You'll see the impact immediately in your Snowflake or Databricks bill."

Phase 3 - Optimize & Scale:
"[Point to Month 2-3] In Months 2 and 3, we expand to all your identified data sources. We optimize policies based on what we learned in the pilot. We train your team so they're self-sufficient. And by the end of Month 3, you've achieved your full 50 to 70 percent cost reduction target."

De-Risk:
"Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What if something goes wrong?' [Point to risk mitigation] We

"Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What if something goes wrong?' [Point to risk mitigation box] We deploy alongside your existing pipelines—zero downtime. We start with just 1 or 2 sources, not everything at once. We have continuous data validation. And if you ever need to roll back—which has never happened—you can do it instantly.

Plus, you have a named Technical Account Manager with 24/7 support and a 1-hour response SLA for critical issues. You're never alone in this."

Team Commitment:
"[Point to team commitment matrix] And your team commitment is minimal. In Week 1-2, about half a person's time. In Weeks 3-4, it ramps up to about 1.5 people. And by Month 3, it drops back down to less than half a person for ongoing management.

Compare that to the typical 6-month data migration project that consumes your entire team. This is 90 days with minimal disruption."

Guaranteed Outcomes:
"[Point to bottom section] And here's our track record: 100% of our customers achieve their target savings. Not 90%. Not 95%. 100%. Because this isn't magic—it's a proven, repeatable process."

Slide 8 Summary:
Purpose: Show clear, de-risked path from decision to value realization
Key Message: Proven 90-day process with 100% success rate
Visual Strategy: Three-phase timeline with activities and outcomes
Risk Mitigation: Zero downtime, gradual rollout, instant rollback
Team Commitment: 1.5 FTEs over 90 days, minimal disruption
Guaranteed Outcomes: Savings Week 1, payback 45-60 days, 100% success

What Makes This Slide Effective:
✅ Removes Uncertainty
Clear 90-day timeline with specific phases and milestones

✅ De-Risks Decision
Zero downtime, gradual rollout, 100% success rate

✅ Shows Fast Value
Savings visible Week 1, not months later

✅ Minimal Disruption
1.5 FTEs over 90 days is manageable for most teams

✅ Included Support
Shows Expanso team commitment at every phase

✅ Proven Process
100% success rate builds confidence

✅ Clear Outcomes
Specific deliverables and metrics at each phase

Presentation Best Practices:
Timing:
Recommended Time: 3-4 minutes
Don't rush—this is where you close the deal
Allow time for questions after each phase
Emphasis:
Highlight "Week 1 savings visible"
Emphasize "100% success rate"
Point out "Zero downtime"
Interaction:
Ask: "Does this timeline work for your planning?"
Gauge: "What concerns do you have about implementation?"
Offer: "Would you like to see a detailed week-by-week plan?"
Common Objections & Responses:
Objection: "90 days seems aggressive"
Response: "That's our proven timeline across 50+ customers. We can adjust if needed, but faster is typically better—every week you wait is another week of unnecessary costs. Would you prefer to start with a longer pilot period?"

Objection: "Our team doesn't have bandwidth"
Response: [Point to team commitment matrix] "I understand. That's why we keep it minimal—1.5 FTEs over 90 days, and most of that is in Weeks 3-4. Compare that to the 6-month migration project that would consume your entire team. Plus, our team does the heavy lifting."

Objection: "What if we need to pause mid-implementation?"
Response: "Absolutely—you're in control. We deploy alongside existing pipelines, so you can pause or roll back at any time. Though I'll note: we've never had a customer pause once they see Week 1 savings."

Objection: "We need to see a proof of concept first"
Response: "That's exactly what Phase 2 is—a production proof of concept with 1-2 sources. You'll see real savings with real data in your environment. Would you like to start with a 30-day POC before committing to the full deployment?"

I need to clarify - we just finished Slide 8 (Implementation Roadmap).

Would you like me to create Slide 9 now?

Based on the flow of the deck, I recommend Slide 9: "Get Started: Your Data Value Assessment" (Call to Action)

This would be the natural closing slide that transitions from "Here's how we'll do it" → "Here's how to start"

Slide 9 Options:

"Get Started: Your Data Value Assessment" (RECOMMENDED)

Clear call to action
3-step process to begin
What they'll get from the assessment
How to schedule
"Investment & ROI: Your Numbers"

Pricing model explanation
ROI calculator
Payback period analysis
Cost comparison
"Enterprise Ready: Security, Scale & Support"

SOC 2 certification
Global scale capabilities
Support model details
Partnership ecosystem
"Questions & Next Steps"

FAQ section
Discussion prompts
Contact information
Multiple engagement options
Which direction would you like for Slide 9?

My recommendation is Option 1: "Get Started: Your Data Value Assessment" because:

Natural flow from implementation roadmap
Clear, low-friction next step
Provides immediate value (free assessment)
Easy decision for prospect to make
Moves deal forward without requiring budget approval yet
Should I build that one?

08:12 PM

please build slide 9

│  Q: What if we don't have exact cost numbers?              │
│  A: That's fine—we can work with estimates and validate    │
│     during the assessment. Many customers start with       │
│     approximate numbers.                                    │

│  Q: Do we need to prepare anything?                        │
│  A: Helpful but not required: current platform costs,      │
│     data volumes, and top pain points. We'll guide you     │

│  Q: Is there really no obligation?                         │
│  A: Absolutely none. The assessment is complimentary and   │
│     you decide next steps after seeing your ROI model.     │

│  Q: How accurate are the projections?                      │
│  A: Very accurate—our models are based on 50+ customer     │
│     deployments. Actual savings typically match or exceed  │
│     projections.                                            │

│  Q: What if our savings are lower than average?            │
│  A: We'll tell you honestly. If Expanso isn't a good fit,  │
│     we'll say so. But 100% of assessments so far have      │

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"So you've seen the proof, you understand the process. Now the question is: What's next? And I want to make this as easy as possible for you."

Introduce the Assessment:
"The next step is a complimentary Data Value Assessment. This is a 45-minute workshop where we'll sit down with your data platform team and do three things:

[Point to deliverables]

First, we'll build you a custom ROI model showing your specific savings potential—not generic numbers, but your actual platforms, your actual volumes, your actual costs.

Second, we'll identify your top 3 quick-win opportunities. These are the data sources and policies that will deliver the fastest ROI—the low-hanging fruit that gets you savings in Week 1.

Third, we'll design your custom implementation roadmap. Not our standard 90-day plan, but one tailored to your team, your timeline, and your constraints."

The Process:
"[Point to 4-step process] Here's how it works:

Step 1: We schedule a 45-minute workshop with your data platform lead and a data engineer. That's it—two people, 45 minutes.

Step 2: We analyze your data estate—volumes, usage patterns, costs, pain points.

Step 3: Within 48 hours, you receive a complete package: Custom ROI model, quick-win opportunities, implementation roadmap, and an executive business case you can present to leadership.

Step 4: You decide. No pressure, no obligation. If the numbers make sense, we can do a 30-day proof of concept or go straight to full deployment. If they don't, we part as friends."

Address Hesitation:
"Now, I know what some of you might be thinking: 'This sounds like a sales pitch disguised as an assessment.' Let me be clear: [Pause]

This is a real assessment with real deliverables. You'll walk away with a custom ROI model, a business case, and a roadmap—whether you move forward with Expanso or not. We've done over 200 of these assessments, and the insights are valuable even if you decide to implement this yourself or with another vendor."

Show Sample:
"[Point to sample ROI model] Here's what a typical assessment looks like. We map your current state—in this example, $5.5 million in annual platform costs. We calculate your future state with Expanso—$1.9 million. That's $3.6 million in annual savings, a 52-day payback period, and a 9.2x first-year ROI.

These aren't hypothetical numbers. They're based on your actual data, validated against 50+ customer deployments."

Social Proof:
"[Point to testimonials] And don't just take my word for it. Here's what customers say about the assessment process. [Read one testimonial]"

The Ask:
"So here's what I'd like to do: Let's schedule your Data Value Assessment this week. I have availability [specific days/times]. Which works better for you—[Day 1] or [Day 2]?"

Alternative Close (If They Hesitate):
"Or if you'd prefer, I can send you a calendar link and you can pick a time that works for your team. Either way, 45 minutes from now, you'll have a clear picture of your savings potential and a concrete path forward. Sound fair?"

Slide 9 Summary:
Purpose: Drive to clear, low-friction next action (Data Value Assessment)
Key Message: Get custom ROI model and business case in 48 hours—no cost, no obligation
Visual Strategy: Clear deliverables + simple 4-step process + prominent CTA
Value Proposition: Immediate, tangible value regardless of purchase decision
Call to Action: Multiple paths to schedule (calendar, email, phone, QR code)

What Makes This Slide Effective:
✅ Clear Value Exchange
Shows exactly what they get (ROI model, roadmap, business case) for 45 minutes

✅ Low Friction
45 minutes, no cost, no obligation = easiest possible next step

✅ Removes Risk
"Decide after you see the numbers" eliminates commitment pressure

✅ Immediate Value
They get useful deliverables even if they don't buy

✅ Multiple CTAs
Calendar link, email, phone, QR code = removes barriers to action

✅ Social Proof
Testimonial from assessment participant validates the process

✅ Specific Deliverables
Not vague "consultation"—concrete outputs with clear value

Presentation Best Practices:
Timing:
Recommended Time: 2-3 minutes
This is your close—don't rush it
Allow time for questions and scheduling
Emphasis:
Highlight "complimentary" and "no obligation"
Emphasize the deliverables (ROI model, business case)
Point out "48 hours" for fast turnaround
Interaction:
Direct ask: "Can we schedule this for [specific day]?"
Alternative close: "Which works better—[Day 1] or [Day 2]?"
Assumptive close: "Let me pull up my calendar..."
Common Objections & Responses:
Objection: "We need to discuss internally first"
Response: "Absolutely—and that's exactly why the assessment is valuable. It gives you the data and business case you need for that internal discussion. Why don't we schedule it for next week, giving you time to brief your team?"

Objection: "We're not ready to commit to anything"
Response: "And you don't have to. The assessment has zero obligation. You'll get a custom ROI model and business case whether you move forward or not. Think of it as free consulting—45 minutes that could identify millions in savings."

Objection: "Can you just send us the information?"
Response: "I can send you general information, but the real value is in the custom analysis. Generic numbers don't help you make a decision. Your specific ROI model—based on your platforms, your volumes, your costs—that's what gets leadership approval. And it only takes 45 minutes."

Objection: "We need to finish [other project] first"
Response: "I understand. When does that project wrap up? Let's schedule the assessment for right after—that way you'll have your ROI model ready when you're ready to move forward. Would [date 2-4 weeks out] work?"

Objection: "Our data is too complex/unique"
Response: "That's exactly what we hear from everyone—and it's exactly why we do custom assessments instead of generic proposals. We've worked with companies in [their industry] with similar complexity. The assessment will show whether Expanso is a good fit for your specific situation."

Objection: "What if we don't have all our numbers ready?"
Response: [Point to FAQ] "We can work with estimates. Most customers start with approximate numbers and we validate during the assessment. The key is understanding your architecture and pain points—we can get exact numbers later."

If They Say Yes:
Immediate Actions:
Pull up calendar: "Great! Let me pull up my calendar right now..."
Confirm attendees: "Who from your team should attend? I recommend your Data Platform Lead and a Data Engineer..."
Send invite immediately: "I'm sending you a calendar invite right now with the agenda and preparation tips..."
Set expectations: "I'll send a brief questionnaire 24 hours before—it's optional but helps us maximize the 45 minutes..."
Confirm deliverables: "And remember, within 48 hours you'll have your custom ROI model, roadmap, and business case..."

If They Hesitate:
Soft Close Options:
Option 1: Take-Away Close

"No pressure at all. Why don't I send you the calendar link and some additional information? You can schedule when you're ready. Sound fair?"

Option 2: Calendar Link

"Tell you what—let me send you my calendar link. You can pick a time that works for your team, and if something comes up, you can always reschedule. Does that work?"

Option 3: Information First

"Would it help if I sent you an overview of the assessment process and some sample deliverables? That way you can see what you'd get before committing the time?"

Option 4: Later Date

"I understand timing might not be right this week. When would be a better time? I have availability [2-4 weeks out]."

Option 5: Different Format

"Would a shorter 30-minute call work better? We can do a high-level discussion and you can decide if you want the full assessment."

Follow-Up Cadence (If They Don't Schedule Immediately):
Day 1 (Same Day):
Send summary email with deck attached
Include calendar link
Reiterate no-obligation offer
Day 3:
Follow-up email: "Had a chance to review?"
Share one customer success story relevant to their industry
Offer to answer questions
Day 7:
Follow-up email: "Checking in"
Share new content (blog post, case study, webinar)
Ask if timing has changed
Day 14:
Final follow-up: "Still interested?"
Offer alternative engagement (webinar, demo, technical session)
Leave door open for future
Day 30:
Move to nurture campaign
Quarterly check-ins
Share relevant content and customer stories
Metrics to Track:
Conversion Metrics:
% who schedule assessment during presentation
% who schedule within 24 hours
% who schedule within 1 week
% who complete assessment once scheduled
% who move to POC/deployment after assessment
Assessment Quality Metrics:
Average projected savings ($M)
Average time to deliver ROI model (hours)
% who say assessment was valuable
% who share ROI model with leadership
% who request reference calls after assessment
Drop-Off Analysis:
Where do prospects hesitate? (scheduling, attendees, timing)
Common objections at this stage
What information requests delay scheduling
A/B Testing Recommendations:
Test these variations:

Version A: Deliverables-First
Lead with what they'll receive (current recommended version)

Version B: Process-First
Lead with how easy/fast it is (4-step process upfront)

Version C: Testimonial-First
Lead with social proof (customer quote at top)

Version D: Question-Driven
Lead with questions we'll answer ("How much will you save?")

Track: Which version drives highest scheduling rate

Presentation Closing:
Strong Close:
"So that's Expanso—the upstream data platform that cuts costs by 50 to 70 percent. You've seen the proof across industries. You understand the process. And you know the path forward.

The next step is simple: Let's spend 45 minutes together, analyze your specific situation, and show you exactly how much you'll save. No cost, no obligation—just clarity.

I have availability this week on [Day 1] and [Day 2]. Which works better for your team?"

Alternative Close (Softer):
"I know that's a lot of information. Let me summarize the key points:

[Recap 3 key messages]

Proven 50-70% cost reduction across 50+ customers
90-day deployment with savings visible Week 1
Zero risk with our proven implementation process
The next step is a complimentary Data Value Assessment where we'll build you a custom ROI model. It's 45 minutes with no obligation.

What questions do you have? And when would be a good time to schedule that assessment?"

Interactive Close:
"Before we wrap up, I want to make sure I've addressed your key concerns. What questions do you have?

[Answer questions]

Great. So based on what you've seen today, does this look like something that could help your organization?

[If yes] Excellent. Let's get your Data Value Assessment scheduled...

[If hesitation] I understand. What would you need to see or know to feel comfortable moving forward?"

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"Before we wrap up, I want to address the enterprise buying criteria—because I know these matter for organizations of your scale."

Security:
"[Point to Security section] First, security and compliance. We're SOC 2 Type II certified. We're GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliant. We do quarterly penetration testing by third parties. And we support all the security features you'd expect—end-to-end encryption, zero-trust architecture, SSO integration, complete audit trails.

Your data stays in your network, in your VPC, under your control. We never see your actual data—we just process it according to your policies."

Scale:
"[Point to Scale section] Second, scale. We're proven at petabyte scale, processing billions of events per day. We have a 99.9% uptime SLA with zero data loss guarantees. We support multi-cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and edge deployments. And we auto-scale to handle your peak loads plus 50% headroom."

Support:
"[Point to Support section] Third, support. Every Enterprise customer gets a named Technical Account Manager—24/7/365. You get a 1-hour response SLA for critical issues. You have direct access to our engineering team. You get quarterly business reviews, architecture reviews, and input into our product roadmap.

This isn't throw-it-over-the-wall software. We're your partner in success."

Partnerships:
"[Point to Partnerships section] Fourth, partnerships. We're an AWS Technology Partner, Microsoft Partner, and Google Cloud Partner. We're a Snowflake Technology Partner and Databricks Technology Partner. We work closely with the platforms you already use to make them better, not replace them."

Financial Stability:
"[Point to Financial section] And finally, financial stability. We're backed by General Catalyst and other tier-one investors. We've raised [amount] in funding with 3+ years of runway. We're growing 200% year-over-year with 95% customer retention. We're not going anywhere."

Closing:
"The bottom line: Expanso is enterprise-ready from day one. We have the security, the scale, the support, the partnerships, and the financial backing to be your long-term data platform partner."

│  A: No. Our per-node pricing includes unlimited data       │

## **Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):**

### **Opening:**
> "You're probably evaluating other solutions, so let me be transparent about how we compare to the main alternatives you'll see."

### **Cribl Comparison:**
> "**[Point to Cribl column]** Cribl is a strong solution for observability pipelines. They do a great job optimizing SIEM costs—typically 35% savings on Splunk or Datadog.

> **[Point to Expanso column]** Where Expanso is different: We handle ALL your enterprise data, not just observability. We optimize Snowflake, Databricks, AND your SIEM platforms. And we deliver 50-70% savings across your entire data estate, not just one category.

> The buyer is different too. Cribl typically sells to DevOps and SRE teams. We sell to Data Platform Engineering and FinOps—teams responsible for the entire data budget."

### **Fivetran Comparison:**
> "**[Point to Fivetran column]** Fivetran and Airbyte are excellent data integration tools. They have 500+ connectors and make it easy to replicate SaaS data into your warehouse.

> **[Point to Expanso column]** But here's the key difference: They move ALL your data, which is why your Snowflake bill keeps growing. We filter 50-70% of unnecessary data BEFORE it moves.

> **[Pause]** And here's what's interesting: Many of our customers use BOTH. They use Expanso upstream for optimization and Fivetran for SaaS connector breadth. They're complementary."

### **Monte Carlo Comparison:**
> "**[Point to Monte Carlo column]** Monte Carlo is the leader in data observability. They're excellent at detecting data quality issues in your warehouse.

> **[Point to Expanso column]** The fundamental difference: They detect problems downstream. We prevent problems upstream. They monitor data quality after data arrives. We filter bad data before it moves.

> And critically: They add cost to your stack. We reduce it by 50-70%."

### **TCO Analysis:**
> "**[Point to TCO comparison]** Let me show you the math over 3 years.

> With Cribl, you save about $4.6 million—but only on observability costs. Your analytics costs keep growing.

> With Fivetran, you actually ADD $900K to your total spend. They provide value through automation, but they don't reduce platform costs.

> With Expanso, you save $17.25 million over 3 years—because we optimize ALL your platforms simultaneously.

> **[Point to Expanso box]** That's 3.7x better ROI than Cribl, and we're the only solution that dramatically reduces your total data spend."

### **Unique Differentiators:**
> "**[Point to unique differentiators]** So what does only Expanso do?

> We're the only platform that handles observability AND analytics AND IoT data in one solution.

> We're the only solution that reduces platform costs by 50-70%.

> We're the only platform that prevents problems upstream instead of detecting them downstream.

> And we're the only solution with predictable per-node pricing—no consumption surprises."

### **Closing:**
> "Look, all of these vendors have their place. Cribl is great for observability-only use cases. Fivetran is excellent for SaaS connector breadth. Monte Carlo is strong for warehouse monitoring.

> But if you want to dramatically reduce your data platform costs across ALL your platforms—Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog—while improving performance and automating compliance, Expanso is the only solution that delivers that."

## **Objection Handling Built Into This Slide:**

### **Objection 1: "We're already using [competitor]"**
**Answer Built In**: TCO comparison shows switching saves millions over 3 years

### **Objection 2: "Why not just use Cribl?"**
**Answer Built In**: Cribl only handles observability (35% savings), Expanso handles all data (50-70% savings)

### **Objection 3: "Can't we use Fivetran for this?"**
**Answer Built In**: Fivetran replicates, doesn't optimize. Use both together.

### **Objection 4: "What about Monte Carlo?"**
**Answer Built In**: Monte Carlo detects (and adds cost), Expanso prevents (and reduces cost)

### **Objection 5: "These tools seem complementary, not competitive"**
**Answer Built In**: Exactly—many customers use Expanso WITH these tools for best results

## **Common Questions This Slide Answers:**

### **Q: "How do you compare to Cribl?"**
**A**: Cribl = observability only, 35% savings. Expanso = all data, 50-70% savings

### **Q: "Why not just use Fivetran?"**
**A**: Fivetran moves data, doesn't reduce costs. Use both together.

### **Q: "What about Monte Carlo for data quality?"**
**A**: Monte Carlo detects downstream, we prevent upstream. Complementary.

### **Q: "Who are your main competitors?"**
**A**: Depends on use case—Cribl (observability), Fivetran (integration), Monte Carlo (quality)

### **Q: "Why should we choose you over them?"**
**A**: Only solution that reduces costs 50-70% across ALL platforms

### **Q: "Can we use you together with [competitor]?"**
**A**: Yes! Many customers use Expanso + Fivetran, or Expanso + dbt

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"You've seen one detailed example. Let me show you the breadth—we're delivering similar results across industries."

Healthcare Example:
"[Point to healthcare] In healthcare, the challenge is often medical device data overwhelming SIEM platforms, combined with HIPAA compliance concerns.

This regional health system had 15,000 medical devices generating logs—80% of which were just routine heartbeat messages. They saved 72% on Splunk costs while achieving 100% HIPAA compliance through automated PHI masking."

Answers to your most common questions Complete Slide Layout (Recommended Version):

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ Frequently Asked Questions │ │ Answers to your most common questions │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 💰 PRICING & ROI: │ │ │ │ Q: How much does Expanso cost? │ │ A: Per-node annual subscription starting at $X,XXX/node. │ │ Volume discounts available. Includes unlimited data │ │ volume, all features, enterprise support, and │ │ implementation. Typical customer ROI: 8-10x first year. │ │ │ │ Q: What counts as a "node"? │ │ A: A node is any server, VM, or edge location where │ │ Expanso agents run. Typically: application servers, │ │ data sources, or edge gateways. We'll help you │ │ calculate exact node count during assessment. │ │ │ │ Q: Are there any hidden fees or per-GB charges? │ │ A: No. Per-node pricing includes unlimited data volume. │ │ No ingestion fees, no storage fees, no compute fees, │ │ no egress fees. What you see is what you pay. │ │ │ │ Q: How quickly will we see ROI? │ │ A: Typical payback period: 45-60 days. Savings are │ │ visible in Week 1 of production deployment. Average │ │ first-year ROI: 8.2x across all customers. │ │ │ │ Q: Can we start small and expand? │ │ A: Yes. Many customers start with 10-20 nodes (pilot), │ │ validate ROI, then expand. Volume discounts apply │ │ automatically as you grow. No penalties for starting │ │ small. │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 🔧 TECHNICAL & IMPLEMENTATION: │ │ │ │ Q: How long does implementation take? │ │ A: Pilot deployment: 2-4 weeks. Full production: 60-90 │ │ days. We provide full implementation support: solutions │ │ architect, implementation engineer, and ongoing TAM. │ │ │ │ Q: Will this disrupt our existing pipelines? │ │ A: No. Expanso deploys alongside existing pipelines with │ │ zero downtime. We start with 1-2 pilot sources, test │ │ thoroughly, then expand. Instant rollback capability │ │ (never needed). │ │ │ │ Q: What if we don't have exact cost numbers ready? │ │ A: That's fine. We can work with estimates during the │ │ Data Value Assessment and validate exact numbers │ │ later. Most customers start with approximate costs. │ │ │ │ Q: Do we need to change our existing tools or workflows? │ │ A: No. Expanso sits upstream and works WITH your existing │ │ tools (Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, etc.). No │ │ rip-and-replace. Your teams keep using familiar tools. │ │ │ │ Q: What's the learning curve for our team? │ │ A: Minimal. Policies are declarative YAML/JSON (similar │ │ to Kubernetes). We provide full training, documentation,│ │ and pre-built policy templates. Most teams productive │ │ in days, not weeks. │ │ │ │ Q: Can we deploy on-premises or does it require cloud? │ │ A: Both. Expanso supports cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), │ │ on-premises (VMs, bare metal), hybrid, and edge │ │ deployments. You choose what works for your │ │ environment. │ │ │ │ Q: What happens if our data volumes spike unexpectedly? │ │ A: Expanso auto-scales to handle spikes. Our customers │ │ routinely handle 5-10x traffic spikes (e.g., Black │ │ Friday) without issues. Plus, filtering reduces the │ │ volume hitting downstream platforms. │ │ │ │ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │ │ │ │ 🔒 SECURITY & COMPLIANCE: │ │ │ │ Q: Is Expanso secure enough for our enterprise? │ │ A: Yes. SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA │ │ compliant, end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3), quarterly │ │ penetration testing, zero-trust architecture. Data │ │ processed in YOUR VPC/network—we never see your data. │ │ │ │ Q: Where does our data go? Do you store it? │ │ A: Your data stays in YOUR infrastructure.

Presentation Script (When Delivering This Slide):
Opening:
"Let me tell you a bit about who we are and why we built Expanso."

Mission:
"[Point to mission] Our mission is simple: eliminate the data tax that enterprises pay for unnecessary data processing. We saw this problem firsthand at Google, AWS, and Microsoft—enterprises wasting billions moving data they never use."

Leadership Team:
"[Point to founders] We're not a typical startup. Our founding team comes from Google, AWS, and Microsoft—we've built the very systems that enterprises rely on today.

David led Kubernetes and GKE at Google and co-founded Kubeflow. Walid architected AWS CloudWatch and Kinesis. Tony scaled operations at McKinsey and Microsoft.

We've operated data infrastructure at petabyte scale. We've lived the pain our customers feel."

Traction:
"[Point to growth metrics] Since founding in 2021, we've grown to 50+ enterprise customers including Fortune 500 companies and the U.S. Government. We've delivered over $100 million in customer value with a 95% retention rate.

More importantly: 100% of our customers achieve their target savings. Zero data loss incidents across all deployments. These aren't marketing claims—this is our track record."

Financial Stability:
"[Point to funding] We're backed by General Catalyst—the same tier-one VC that backed Stripe, Datadog, and Airbnb. We have 3+ years of runway, 200% year-over-year growth, and profitable unit economics.

You're not betting on a startup that might disappear. We're here for the long term."

Why It Matters:
"[Point to why customers trust us] When you choose Expanso, you're not just buying software. You're partnering with a team that's been in your shoes, a company that's financially stable, and a platform that's proven at Fortune 500 scale.

We're invested in your success—literally. Your success is our success."
