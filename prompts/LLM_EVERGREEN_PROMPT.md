PERMANENT SLIDE DESIGN RULES & BRAND GUIDELINES (RULES ONLY)
10/20/30 PRESENTATION RULE (ALWAYS ENFORCE)
For ALL slide requests, automatically apply Guy Kawasaki's 10/20/30 rule:

10 SLIDES MAXIMUM - No presentation should exceed 10 slides. Each slide = one key concept.

20 MINUTES MAXIMUM - Content should be deliverable in 20 minutes or less, leaving time for discussion.

30 POINT FONT MINIMUM - All body text must be 30pt or larger. Headlines should be significantly larger (60-96pt).

Design Implications:

Ruthlessly minimize text - if it doesn't fit in 30pt font, it doesn't belong on the slide
One idea per slide - force clarity by limiting concepts
Visual over verbal - use images, diagrams, data visualizations instead of text blocks
No bullet point essays - maximum 3-5 short bullet points per slide
Speaker notes, not slide text - detailed information belongs in presenter notes
Audience attention - assume 20-minute attention span; design accordingly
Enforcement:

Count total slides and flag if approaching/exceeding 10
Estimate speaking time and warn if content requires more than 20 minutes
Check all font sizes and reject anything under 30pt for body text
Challenge every line of text: "Does the audience NEED to read this, or can the speaker say it?"
EXPANSO BRAND VOICE & MESSAGING RULES
Core Positioning
What We Do: Filter, transform, and govern data at the source (edge, on-prem, hybrid, cloud) before it reaches expensive downstream platforms
Spatial Language: "At the source" / "Where data lives" / "Before platforms ingest"
NEVER USE: "Upstream" (too technical, requires explanation)
Category: Data control layer / Source-side data infrastructure
Key Differentiation: Process data WHERE IT LIVES vs. competitors who centralize everything
Three-Pillar Framework (User's Internal Positioning)


1. Take control of your data at the source (cost, security, governance)
2. Speed your team velocity (reliable pipelines, less toil)
3. Make your organization AI ready (clean, structured data)
Note: This framework is strong for internal alignment but needs refinement for customer-facing slides. Consider outcome-driven alternatives for specific audiences.

Voice & Tone - DO's
Lead with measurable outcomes: "50-70% volume reduction", "$1.77M annual savings", "16× faster queries"
Use active, imperative verbs: "Filter", "Deploy", "Cut", "Control", "Accelerate", "Enable"
Make technical concepts concrete:
"Data gravity" = expensive data movement to centralized platforms
"At the source" = edge/on-prem/before cloud ingestion
"Policy-driven" = set rules once, enforce everywhere automatically
Show before/after contrast: "Chaos → control", "Firefighting → building", "Garbage → AI-ready"
Name specific platforms: "Snowflake", "Databricks", "Splunk", "Datadog" - never generic "analytics tools"
Use sentence fragments for emphasis: "High-value data only. Faster queries. Better insights."
Provide proof immediately after claims: Don't say "significant savings" - say "$1.77M saved (Fortune 500 retail)"
Voice & Tone - DON'Ts
Never use vague value propositions: "innovative solutions", "best-in-class", "revolutionary platform", "next-generation"
Never bury the metric: Don't say "significant cost reduction" when you mean "58% reduction"
Never use passive voice for key benefits: Not "costs are reduced" but "Cut costs by 58%"
Never use jargon without context: If you must use "data gravity" or technical terms, define them immediately
Never create villain narratives: Don't attack Snowflake/Databricks—position as complementary enhancement
Never promise perfection: Focus on dramatic improvement ("50-70% reduction") not utopian outcomes ("eliminate all costs")
Key Metrics Library (Always Use Specific Numbers)
50-70% data volume reduction
$1.77M annual savings (Fortune 500 retail case study)
58% cost reduction (across Snowflake + Datadog)
88% reduction in cloud egress costs
50% reduction in data onboarding time
16× faster queries (due to cleaner data)
Zero pipeline failures (production environments)
<30 seconds to propagate updates across 10,000+ nodes
Storage costs: $83/TB centralized → $35/TB distributed
Target Audience Pain Points (Map Messaging to These)
Runaway platform costs - Snowflake/Splunk/Datadog bills consuming 30-40% of data budget
Pipeline instability - Firefighting, brittle connectors, manual configuration across distributed systems
Compliance gaps - Unmasked PII, lack of data lineage, audit burden
Data gravity - Expensive centralization, query performance degradation, egress costs
Team scaling - Cannot hire engineers fast enough to match infrastructure growth
AI/ML blockers - Garbage data quality, unknown lineage, unstructured formats
VISUAL DESIGN SYSTEM
Color Palette
Primary Colors:

Navy Blue: #0A1628 (primary background)
Charcoal: #1A2332 (secondary background)
Pure White: #FFFFFF (headlines, high-emphasis text)
Electric Cyan: #00D9FF (accent - use sparingly for metrics, CTAs, emphasis)
Grayscale Text Hierarchy:

Level 1 (Headlines): #FFFFFF (pure white)
Level 2 (Body text): #D4D9E0 (light gray)
Level 3 (Secondary text): #B8BFC7 (medium gray)
Level 4 (Tertiary text): #8A95A3 (dim gray)
Level 5 (Watermark/subtle): #5A6570 (very dim gray)
Contrast Requirements:

All text must meet WCAG AAA standards (7:1 contrast minimum)
White (#FFFFFF) on Navy (#0A1628) = 15.8:1 ratio ✓
Light gray (#D4D9E0) on Navy = 12.2:1 ratio ✓
Typography System
Font Family: Modern sans-serif only

Preferred: Inter, Helvetica Neue, or SF Pro Display
Fallback: Arial, Roboto
Never use: Serif fonts, script fonts, decorative fonts
Type Hierarchy:

Level 1 (Hero/Main headline): 72-96pt, Semi-bold (600), White
Level 2 (Subheadlines/Key points): 42-60pt, Medium (500), Light gray
Level 3 (Body text/Bullets): 30-36pt minimum, Regular (400), Light gray
Level 4 (Footer/Attribution): 18-24pt, Regular (400), Dim gray
Metrics/Numbers: 96-144pt, Bold (700), White or Cyan accent
Typography Rules:

NEVER go below 30pt for body text (10/20/30 rule)
Use sentence case for body text, title case for headlines
Limit line length to 60-80 characters for readability
Line height: 1.4-1.6 for body text, 1.1-1.2 for headlines
Letter spacing: -1% to -2% for large headlines (tighter = more premium)
Layout Principles
Slide Format:

16:9 aspect ratio (1920px × 1080px)
80px safe margins from all edges
12-column grid system with 20px gutters (optional but recommended for alignment)
Whitespace Requirements:

Minimum 60% whitespace on every slide
Signals confidence: "We don't need to fill every pixel to prove value"
Prevents cognitive overload
Improves legibility from distance
Alignment:

Centered alignment for hero content (taglines, key metrics)
Left-aligned for body text and bullet lists (easier to read)
Consistent alignment throughout deck (don't mix arbitrarily)
Focal Points:

One focal point per slide - the element that draws attention first
Use size, color, and position to create clear hierarchy
Typical focal point: Large metric, headline, or simple diagram
Background Treatment
Default Background:

Deep navy (#0A1628) to charcoal (#1A2332) diagonal gradient
Gradient angle: 135° (top-left to bottom-right)
Gradient stops: 0% #0A1628, 50% #0F1E2E, 100% #1A2332
Subtle noise texture overlay at 3% opacity (adds depth, prevents flat digital look)
Optional Accent Elements:

Very subtle data flow lines: 0.5px width, white at 4% opacity, positioned on right 40% of slide
Abstract geometric shapes: Thin lines (1-2px), white at 6-8% opacity, top-right corner
Radial glow behind key elements: Cyan (#00D9FF) at 3-5% opacity, heavy blur (150px+)
Background Rules:

Never use busy patterns or competing visual elements
Never use images as backgrounds (reduces text legibility)
Keep backgrounds consistent across entire deck
Visual Elements
Diagrams & Icons:

Style: Minimal, geometric, clean lines
Colors: White and cyan on dark background
Line weight: 2-4px for clarity
Purpose: Support message, never purely decorative
Complexity: Simple enough to understand in 3 seconds
Data Visualizations:

Use when data tells the story better than words
Keep charts simple: bar, line, or simple comparison
Limit to 3-5 data points per chart
Large, readable labels (30pt minimum)
Highlight key insight with cyan accent
Logos:

Company logo: Top-left, 280px max width, 80px from edges
Customer/partner logos: Grayscale or muted color, equal sizing, 4-6 maximum per slide
Platform logos (Snowflake, Databricks, etc.): Full color, used in context of integration/compatibility

Lead with customer pain point
Include customer logos and testimonials
Focus on ROI and time-to-value
Use three-pillar framework to address multiple buyer personas
For Conference Talks:

Lead with provocative problem statement
Use David's contrarian voice
Include more visuals, less text
Consider "Stop Moving Garbage Data" for attention

PERMANENT RULE: WORD FATIGUE AVOIDANCE
For all future slides:

When creating crisp, minimal slides, avoid repeating words across text elements to prevent word fatigue and maintain audience engagement.

Examples of word fatigue to avoid:

❌ Tagline: "Control Your Data" → Pillar: "Take control of your data at the source"
❌ Pillar 1: "Speed your team" → Pillar 2: "Speed your deployment"
❌ Headline: "AI-ready data" → Body: "Make your data AI-ready"
How to avoid word fatigue:

Use synonyms: Control → Command → Manage → Own
Vary sentence structure: "Control costs" vs "Reduce expenses" vs "Cut spending"
Use different parts of speech: "Control" (verb) vs "Governance" (noun)
Check for repetition: Before finalizing, scan all text elements on slide for repeated words
Prioritize most important usage: If a word must appear twice, use it in the most prominent position first
Exceptions where repetition is acceptable:

Company/product names (Expanso, Snowflake, etc.)
Technical terms with no clear synonym (Kubernetes, API, etc.)
Intentional rhetorical repetition for emphasis ("Data. Data. Data.")
This rule applies to:

Title slides
Section divider slides
Any slide with <50 words total
Slides where every word is highly visible (large fonts, minimal text)
This rule is less critical for:

Dense content slides with multiple paragraphs
Technical specification slides
Appendix/reference slides


## CRITICAL VIEWPORT AUTO-FIT RULE - CALCULATE FIRST, BUILD SECOND

**MANDATORY FOR EVERY SLIDE:**

All slide content MUST fit within the viewport without vertical scrolling.

**Formula:**
```
Total Vertical Content Height < Viewport Height - 100px padding
```

**For 1080p (1920×1080) slides:**
- Maximum usable height: **~850px** (hard limit)
- Safe target height: **~750-800px** (recommended)
- Strategy: Start 30-40% smaller than ideal projection specs
- ALWAYS calculate total height BEFORE writing any code

**MANDATORY PRE-BUILD CALCULATION:**

Before writing ANY slide code, complete this calculation:

```
SLIDE HEIGHT BUDGET CALCULATOR:
==============================

1. PADDING (top + bottom):        _____px
2. TITLE SECTION (including margin): _____px
3. SECTION 1 (header + content + margin): _____px
4. SECTION 2 (header + content + margin): _____px
5. SECTION 3 (header + content + margin): _____px
6. SECTION N (header + content + margin): _____px
7. FOOTER/CAPTION (including margin): _____px
8. GAPS/DIVIDERS (all combined):  _____px

TOTAL HEIGHT: _____px

✅ IF < 850px → PROCEED
❌ IF > 850px → REDUCE ALL ELEMENTS BY: [(Total - 750) / Total × 100]%
```

**EXAMPLE FOR SLIDE 9 (Design System Colors):**
```
ORIGINAL (FAILED):
- Padding: 80px (40 + 40)
- Title: 112px (72 + 40 margin)
- Band 1 (Primary): 206px (42 header + 140 box + 24 margin)
- Divider: 30px
- Band 2 (Semantic): 206px
- Divider: 30px
- Band 3 (Gradients): 186px (42 header + 120 box + 24 margin)
- Divider: 30px
- Band 4 (Text): 156px (42 header + 80 box + 34 margin)
- Footer: 60px (40 + 20 margin)
TOTAL: 1096px ❌ EXCEEDS LIMIT BY 246px

CORRECTED (28% REDUCTION):
- Padding: 60px (30 + 30)
- Title: 80px (52 + 28 margin)
- Band 1: 135px (28 header + 90 box + 17 margin)
- Divider: 20px
- Band 2: 135px
- Divider: 20px
- Band 3: 125px (28 header + 80 box + 17 margin)
- Divider: 20px
- Band 4: 120px (28 header + 65 box + 27 margin)
- Footer: 45px (30 + 15 margin)
TOTAL: 760px ✅ FITS
```

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- NO EXCEPTIONS - calculate EVERY slide
- Document calculation in code comments
- If slide doesn't fit, it's WRONG - fix immediately
- Always start with 70% of ideal sizes, scale up if room available
